This means that all businesses which make or use packaging – excluding certain smaller companies – have a legal obligation to ensure that a proportion of that they place on the market is recovered and recycled. The regime first came into force in 1997 and was updated in 2007 with the introduction of the Producer Responsibility (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007. There have been a number of amendments to the regulations since 2007. The supermarket selling a product is one type of business which has an obligation under the Packaging Waste Regulations Under the regulations, packaging producers can meet their recycling obligations by buying recycling evidence, known as Packaging Waste Recovery Notes (PRNs), or Packaging Waste Export Recovery Notes (PERNs), from accredited reprocessors or exporters. The system is therefore known to many in the industry as the PRN system. The obligation applies to all those involved in the packaging supply chain – ranging from raw material manufacturers to retailers – which have an annual turnover above £2 million, and which handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year. Organisations can also be obligated if they are part of a group that collectively meets the thresholds. Those obligated companies with a turnover of below £5 million (but above £2 million) can choose to use a simpler allocation method when completing their obligation calculations. Many obligated companies sign up with a Producer Compliance Scheme (PCS), who will buy evidence on their behalf and take on their legal compliance. The number of PRNs that companies have to buy is determined by targets which are set by the UK government, known more commonly as ‘business targets’. So far, business targets have been set for all materials up until 2020 (see targets page). The targets cover paper and card, glass (of which a certain proportion must be sent to remelt), aluminium, steel, plastic and wood and there is also an overall recycling and recovery target, for which a certain percentage must be met through recycling. In March 2019 the UK Government has recently launched a consultation, which closed in May, on options to reform the UK Packaging Waste system. This document, along with other consultations held at the same time, will significantly alter the way in which the UK packaging waste system operates in the future, with significant changes and cost impacts for packaging producers. The intended start date for the new system is the beginning of 2023 Directive The packaging waste obligation requirements stem from European Union legislation The PRN system is designed to enable the UK to meet its targets under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (Packaging Directive). The Directive required that the UK recovered at least 60% of all packaging waste by December 31 2008 as well as meeting a number of other targets, which the UK has achieved. The Circular Economy Package included proposals to amend a number of European Waste Directives, including the Packaging Directive. These amendments were published in June 2018, and include new targets to be met in 2025 and 2030. Unlike the systems in use in many other European countries, the PRN system is a market-based supply and demand mechanism, designed to reduce costs for obligated companies while still ensuring compliance with the European Directive. The system effectively subsidises packaging recycling and means that if the price of recyclables drops, the PRN generally increases in value, thereby providing some protection for the market. Obligation Those who handle packaging and or packaging materials can calculate their obligation based on the amount of packaging they place on the UK market in the previous calendar year. Producers’ obligations are split between different roles within the supply chain, each with a different percentage of responsibility: raw material manufacturer 6%; converter 9%; packer/filler 37%; seller 48%. Importers have a “rolled up” obligation for packaging imported into the UK. OBLIGATIONS: Raw material manufacturer Converter Packer/filler Seller (retailer) 6% 9% 37% 48% The raw material manufacturer makes raw materials for packaging manufacture (such as a steel mill). A packaging converter converts the raw material into packaging, (such as making sheets for cans). A packer filler puts products into the packaging or packaging around the product (such as a company putting baked beans in a can) and the seller supplies an end user, (such as a retailer selling the cans of baked beans to the consumer). Calculation Companies must account for all activities which are carried out on the packaging they handle. The calculation is therefore: packaging placed on the market in the previous year multiplied by responsibility percentage multiplied by national business target. The calculation then provides each obligated business with a fixed tonnage obligation at the start of each year that they must fulfil by proving that they have funded the equivalent tonnage of packaging recycling, thus providing the demand within the market mechanism. For each tonne of packaging material recycled or recovered, the final reprocessor or exporter is entitled to produce a PRN or PERN (Packaging Export Recovery Note) certificate, provided they are audited and accredited by the enforcement agencies. Materials which are exported for recovery are treated equivalently to UK processing as long as the end destination can be shown to the enforcement authority to have broadly equivalent standards. The majority of producers either join a Packaging Compliance Scheme, who will take on their legal obligation and obtain the PRNs on the producer’s behalf, or alternatively the Producer can register direct and can then obtain these certificates themselves, as evidence of meeting their legal obligations. The Advisory Committee on Packaging (ACP) have produced the PRN System Guide which provides a detailed explanation of the UK PRN system. Reporting To monitor fulfilment of the national targets, producers, PCSs and accredited reprocessors and exporters have legal obligations to report certain data to the relevant enforcement agency. All information is maintained on the National Packaging Waste Database (NPWD) and reported to the European Commission. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 2015 As well as the PRN system, there are also regulations which are intended to ensure that packaging placed on the market meets certain requirements. The requirements include ensuring that: The volume and weight of packaging is the minimum to maintain safety, hygiene and acceptance of the packed product for the consumer The packaging adheres to the recyclability / recoverability requirements The packaging design minimises the levels of hazardous or noxious substances which may be emitted at the end of life The packaging adheres to limits on heavy metal substances (calcium, lead, mercury and hexavalent chromium Further information about The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations can be found here. The UK Government intends to review this legislation later in 2019. Enforcement The Packaging Regulations in the UK are enforced by: • England – the Environment Agency (EA) • Wales – the Natural Resources Body for Wales (NRW) • Scotland – the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) • Northern Ireland – the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (via the Northern Ireland Environment Agency [NIEA]) The Essential Requirements Regulations are enforced by local authority Trading Standards services Homepage News Events Packaging Councils Prices Directory Careers Contact us Advertise Cookie settings Privacy Policy & Terms Contact us Full contact information: HERE Our address is: letsrecycle.com, Roar B2B, First Floor, 115 Southwark Bridge Road London SE1 0AX © Roar B2B Ltd 2024.

The investigation has led to calls for Sainsbury’s and Tesco to publicly support the Global Plastics Treaty and end claims around the recyclability of soft plastics. Everyday Plastic put 40 Apple AirTag trackers into bundles of soft plastics and placed them in the collection points at Sainsbury’s and Tesco stores across England. It found that none of the trackers were “closed loop recycled”. Helen Bird, head of materials systems transformation at WRAP, defended the soft plastics recycling schemes in supermarkets. She said: “For something to be ‘recyclable’, it must be designed for recycling as well as collected, processed and remanufactured at scale. Ahead of ‘soft’ plastic recycling directly from our homes – due before 2028, supermarkets stepped up to provide collection points to fill this gap. “While not perfect, these have acted as an important catalyst for crucial investment in UK recycling infrastructure and end markets and instilled new habits in people to separate bags and wrapping for recycling. Much of this material is being recycled into products such as refuse sacks and street furniture, as well as new packaging including Heinz beans ‘snap pots’, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Kingsmill 50/50 and Nestle’s Kit Kat. “But it’s a complex situation. Too much packaging is made from different types of plastics that are difficult to recycle and the end market is not stable. More transparency is needed to provide confidence to people of what’s happening to the collected materials. But there is one thing for certain: if it doesn’t get placed in the recycling, it will not get recycled.” Steve Morgan, head of policy and infrastructure at plastics resource efficiency and recycling organisation, RECOUP, said that ultimately consumers should continue recycling their soft plastics. He said: “We are at the beginning of a process to recycle ‘soft’ plastics, we are learning, and infrastructure is starting to be put in place, with some exciting developments happening in this space. Supermarkets have led the way to provide collections points for this material and I’ve seen ‘front of store’ material at many UK recyclers. “The end game for soft plastics is replacement of virgin material in new plastic packaging. However, in these early stages, some material will inevitably go to energy recovery in the short term as markets are explored and developed, and material design and quality are improved, but in this process it is crucial that it is kept out of the environment and only exported to a confirmed recycler.” “Recycling materials are part of global markets and there might always be stories about the end destination of the materials depending on the quality of the material recycled by the consumer, but with export restrictions, increased auditing and digital waste tracking the picture will improve over time. However, we do call on the government to provide support and incentives so the material can be recycled at scale in the UK as collection levels increase.” The British Plastics Federation (BPF) echoed Morgan: “Using plastic waste to create energy is not the optimal way of dealing with this material. We’d much rather see material kept in functional use for as long as possible. We ask people to remember that putting their used plastic in the appropriate recycling bin, wherever possible, is still the right thing to do to help increase recycling. “Although ‘closed-loop’ recycling is the most desirable route, it is not feasible in all applications, sometimes due to regulations. Recycling plastic into other products still has great benefits in terms of saving energy and reducing the use of virgin material. It is also worth remembering that flexible (soft) plastic packaging is extremely light and resource efficient, and is excellent for keeping down emissions when transporting food and increasing the shelf life of the products inside. “This report shows there is a clear need to increase the UK’s recycling capacity — for all plastic. We would like to see the government investing funds raised from the Plastic Packaging Tax in achieving this, and urgently taking the steps we have repeatedly outlined to encourage the growth of the UK’s ‘advanced recycling’ infrastructure, so that far more of these ‘soft’ plastics (like plastic bags and plastic films) can be recycled here too.” Others in the industry labelled the findings of the report “unsurprising”. CEO of City to Sea Jane Martin said: “We know that current waste management systems cannot manage the amount of soft plastic used, especially as it’s almost impossible to recycle. “The answer to retailers is clear: invest in packaging that lasts. There are numerous reusable packaging success stories across the country, with M&S announcing the expansion of its reuse scheme in partnership with Reposit to 25 stores and engaging over 10,000 shoppers. Instead of breaking consumer trust and burning plastic, retailers can clear the shelves of plastic with packaging that doesn’t need to end up in the bin.” Sian Sutherland, co-founder of A Plastic Planet and the Plastic Health Council, added: “I am not surprised, nor am I shocked by the ‘revelation’ that plastic is burned after years of such practice being evident. Whether the plastic we use is put in a recycling bin or it is set alight on the spot, the impact the material will have on the planet and people will be inevitably be negative. The myth of recycling is starting to unravel, we have seen behind the curtain too many times for it to be a credible solution to stop the plastic crisis. “Production limits on plastic, bans on the vast array of single use items, safe testing of chemicals included in any products or packaging and using systems of refill or natural plastic alternatives. These are the measures that must be introduced globally to ensure we see an end to this crisis. I hope we see such in the final draft of the UN Plastic Treaty in November.” Share this article with others Subscribe for free Subscribe to receive our newsletters and to leave comments.

The world is moving at only about one quarter of the pace needed to reach the SDG health targets by 2030. At the same time, amid this unprecedented global emergency, WHO has continued to support countries to address the myriad health challenges they face. Even with the impact of the pandemic, WHO was able to achieve most of what we set out to do. This year’s Results Report, for the 2020-21 biennium, highlights how WHO staff around the world have worked tirelessly to support countries to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as responding to dozens of other emergencies around the world, including the war in Ukraine. At the same time, we have continued our work against longstanding health challenges, including the recommendation for broad use of the world’s first malaria vaccine, and we are closer than ever to eradicating polio. And we continued to support countries to introduce measures against major disease drivers including tobacco and trans fatty acids. The report illustrates our commitment to accountability, transparency and delivering for impact. It provides a systematic account of how WHO supports countries in their work towards universal health coverage, healthier populations, and health emergency preparedness and response. It also shows how we strengthened WHO’s leadership role. WHO’s commitment to accountability aims to build trust with our Member States and partners, and to support the sustainable financing and success of the Organization. The recommendation by the Member State Working Group on Sustainable Financing to increase assessed contributions to 50% of WHO’s core budget by the 2028-29 biennium is a major step towards empowering WHO to deliver the high-quality, efficient programming and accountability that Member States demand of us, and that the world needs to face an unpredictable future. Our priority in the coming years is to ensure that even more resources are invested in our work in countries, where it matters most. I thank all WHO staff, who continue to demonstrate the values of commitment, integrity, collaboration, compassion and excellence; and I thank all Member States for their continued support and commitment to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable. Read More Watch Video Executive SummaryMeasurable impact in countries lies at the heart of WHO’s mission to promote health, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable. WHO’s strategy, the Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019–2023 (GPW 13) focuses on delivering measurable improvements to health in all countries. The Executive Board recommended the extension of the period of the GPW 13 from 2023 to 2025. GPW 13 set triple billion targets for healthier populations, universal health coverage and health emergencies (one billion more people enjoying better health and well-being, one billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage, and one billion people better protected from health emergencies by 2023), based on the Sustainable Development Goals. It also defines how WHO will help countries attain the targets through leadership, global public health goods and technical products, and country support. The GPW 13 triple billion targets continue to be a powerful force to drive and deliver change. They provide a unified approach to achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and contribute to improvements in healthy life expectancy.Continue reading the full executive summary view | executive summary Executive summary | pdf Feature stories2020-2021, a biennium of colossal challenges in health, with many successes and setbacks.

The aim of the GPW triple billion targets is to improve the health of millions of people around the world by 2023. They will provide a near-term snapshot of the world's progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. Current projected progress in reaching the triple billions targets 900.00 MILLION More people living with better health and well-being by 2023 920.00 Million More people better protected from health emergencies by 2023 270.00 Million More people benefiting from universal health coverage by 2023 ACHIEVING 1 BILLION MORE PEOPLE LIVING WITH BETTER HEALTH AND WELL-BEING Healthier populations: Although the billion target is projected to be almost reached by 2023, progress is about one quarter of what is needed to reach the related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, estimates suggested that 900 million more people would be enjoying better health and well-being in 2023 compared to the 2018 baseline. Current progress reflects improvements made in access to clean household fuels, safe water and sanitation (WASH), and tobacco control. In other areas like obesity and malnutrition, the situation is stagnant or even worsening. Looking ahead, we now know that to achieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, the target needs to be almost 4 billion people reached for every 5-year period. To achieve this, greater focus is being placed on leading indicators for premature mortality and morbidity, such as tobacco, air pollution, road injuries and obesity, which are key levers for increasing healthier lives. Additionally, attention to inequalities between and within countries will be critical, since 80% of the progress in this target to date has been driven by only a handful of countries. To achieve global targets and health for all, it is necessary to ensure that efforts are sustained and that evidence-based policy solutions are not only produced but also are being implemented and driving action in countries. Access | Triple Billion Dashboard read more ACHIEVING 1 BILLION MORE PEOPLE BETTER PROTECTED FROM HEALTH EMERGENCIES Health emergencies protection: Although initial projections anticipated that the billion target for health emergencies protection could be met by 2023, COVID-19 has revealed that no country is fully prepared for a pandemic of such scale. The Prepare indicator shows that country-level preparedness capacities have increased since the 2018 baseline. However, COVID-19 highlighted limitations in current metrics and has prompted the evolution of assessment methods and systematic processes to ensure they are more predictive, dynamic and holistic. Some activities central to health emergencies protection have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Prevent indicator showing more countries experiencing decrease in vaccine coverage for priority pathogens than in the previous year. Equitable access, prevention strategies, and catch-up vaccination efforts must be prioritized, scaled up and accelerated so that coverage does not further decline. The Detect, Notify and Respond indicator shows a different trend: that countries improved the timeliness for detecting events and strengthened critical public health functions such as surveillance. These gains and investments need to be sustained and expanded to cover an increasing number of emergencies. Protecting people in fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable settings who are disproportionately affected by health emergencies is also critical to ensure that no one is left behind. WHO is working with Member States and partners to act on recent reviews, recommendations and resolutions so that the COVID-19 pandemic is the last of its kind. Access | Triple Billion Dashboard read more ACHIEVING 1 BILLION MORE PEOPLE BENEFITING FROM UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE Universal health coverage: The billion target will not be reached by 2023, and progress is less than one quarter of that needed to reach Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 to achieve universal health coverage by 2030. Current estimates suggest that without course correction, we will fall short by 730 million people of reaching 1 billion more people with universal health coverage in 2023. WHO pulse surveys on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reported that 94% of countries experienced disruption to essential health services, which increases the shortfall to 840 million. Overall, progress is still being made with average service coverage improving in most countries; but concerted efforts to meet service delivery targets in specific areas like HIV treatment, childhood immunization and blood pressure control would help to reduce the current gap in reaching the billion target by nearly half. Attention to financial hardship due to health-related spending is also timelier than ever. Over the past two decades, 92 countries have experienced little change or worsening trends in financial protection – which is now exacerbated by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Taking action on recommended policies to minimize fragmented approaches to coverage, establishing universal guarantees focused on high priority health services, and establishing budgetary measures to ensure funds flow to these services, can accelerate progress in both financial protection and service coverage. Primary health care, with its focus on multisectoral action, integrated health services, community empowerment and strengthening overall health systems functions, is a key approach towards realizing universal health coverage. Access | Triple Billion Dashboard read more A MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT WHO PROVIDING BETTER SUPPORT TO COUNTRIES A stronger WHO: The Organization was able to pivot and respond to the immense challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, backed by its transformation initiative, which is bringing about equity-focused leadership, more inclusive governance, a more agile workforce, science and innovation platforms, enhanced resource mobilization, a move towards a more data- and delivery-driven Organization and partnerships for achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals to drive impact in countries. Business continuity was improved by new technologies and new workplace practices. The Organization is strengthening its ability to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment. Methodical measurement of advances towards achieving the Triple Billion targets and the secretariat’s performance through the output scorecard is paving the way for greater transparency and accountability for results. read more Outcome highlightsDuring the biennium 2020-2021, countries put up enormous efforts to address the unrelenting COVID-19 pandemic, with the world’s largest and fastest vaccination drive ever to rollout new COVID-19 vaccines. Despite this, 3.5 million lives were lost to the disease and vaccine hoarding and nationalism led to stark inequities. In many other areas, there were historic achievements, including a record low in cases of wild polio virus, a decline in tobacco users, and important actions to improve food systems. Vaccine equity One billion COVID-19 vaccines were delivered over 12 months by the COVAX Facility, which has been a lifeline to low-income countries. Eliminate trans fats 58 countries, covering 3 billion people, now have policies to eliminate trans fat, a toxic chemical used in processed foods. Tobacco use Tobacco use is decreasing in 150 countries thanks to measures mandated by WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. COVID-19 vaccines WHO listed 10 COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use after safety and efficacy assessments, upon which 101 countries authorized their use within 15 days. Wild polio virus Wild polio virus cases reached the lowest levels ever in 2021, with just six cases globally. HIV/Syphilis 15 countries have eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and/or syphilis. Malaria vaccine The world’s first and only malaria vaccine is expected to save 40 000 to 80 000 lives a year, when used with other malaria control interventions. 14 countries eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease A total of 14 countries eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease during the biennium 2022–2023:- the Democratic Republic of the Congo eliminated dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease);- Benin, Iraq, Malawi, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Togo and Vanuatu eliminated trachoma;- Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Rwanda and Uganda eliminated African trypanosomiasis; and - Bangladesh and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic eliminated lymphatic filariasis. In addition, Bangladesh became the first country in the world to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis, thanks to a collaboration including the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical DiseasesThis brings to 50 the number of countries acknowledged by WHO as having eliminated a neglected tropical disease, marking the halfway point to the 100-country target set for 2030. Sustained political commitment remains critical to achieving the target. Emergency response WHO responded to 87 graded health emergencies in 2020-2021 including COVID-19, which alone caused a reported 6 million deaths.

At global level, rapid detection and investigation of COVID-19 demonstrate the progress that has been made by WHO in public health intelligence, and funding for the COVID-19 response has enabled WHO regional offices to strengthen health emergency information management more broadly by introducing public health surveillance tools such as District Health Information Software 2 and the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources system. This extended capacity provides a platform on which to build the global capacity necessary to detect the emergence of a health emergency and then monitor and guide the subsequent subnational, national, regional and global response.Expansion of the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources system broadened the scope of global public health surveillance and also streamlined and shortened the time required to validate and assess alerts. The system enabled WHO to sift through hundreds of thousands of potential signals every day in 2020, of which over 26 million were related to COVID-19. Funding for the COVID-19 response also enabled disease surveillance systems that record not only disease outbreaks in human populations but also information on potential risks at the human–animal interface (One Health) and signals related to climate change, industrial hazards and conflicts. In all, WHO undertook 41 rapid risk assessments during 2020. But WHO’s role in public health intelligence extends far beyond initial detection and validation of signals to continuous monitoring of emergencies and their risks as they evolve over time. During COVID-19, continuous surveillance and monitoring at global level allowed detection and assessment of variants of concern, partly by adapting and leveraging influenza genomic surveillance networks, and continual reassessment of the appropriate public health and social measures for the evolving epidemiology. Continuous public health intelligence and monitoring are equally important for operational management of more discrete subnational and national emergencies. WHO augments national capacities for emergency response by deploying standard tools and systems such as the Early Warning, Alert and Response System and Go.Data. In some countries, these tools were already being used to support national surveillance capacity for other health emergencies and could rapidly be adapted to the new pandemic. One of the key challenges beyond COVID-19 and one of the greatest opportunities to shorten the time between emergence of a health hazard and its detection is strengthening national surveillance capacity as part of strengthening broader health emergency preparedness and readiness. This requires implementation of the recommendations of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) review committee to improve the tools available to national IHR focal points, and which emphasized the importance of ensuring that Member States effectively report and share information with WHO.The aim is to move beyond detection of an event as the single driver of a change in operational readiness and response. The abundance and diversity of data now available, with the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning, open the door to sophisticated predictive analytics and modelling, which could augment the rapid advances already under way in all-hazards surveillance. Realizing this potential will require transformation of WHO’s digital and data infrastructure as part of broader work to harness new and emerging technologies to improve the global system of health emergency preparedness, alert and response. Building global health emergency surveillance capacity based on 21st century technology is the only way to arm the world against 21st century threats. But these capacities can be built only if we sustain and institutionalize the capacity built in response to COVID-19.RespondCOVID-19 rightly attracted most attention throughout 2020, but it was only one of 53 graded emergencies to which WHO responded during the 12-month period, which included concurrent public health emergencies of international concern such as the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and of polio in the Horn of Africa. Twelve new graded emergencies during 2020 required WHO to activate its emergency standard operating procedures, ranging from the global COVID-19 pandemic to the acute technological disaster of the Beirut Port explosion, natural disasters and complex humanitarian emergencies. The WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies was used for rapid responses and continuation of essential responses to 14 emergencies in all the WHO regions except that of the Americas. A total of US$ 43.7 million were allocated through the Fund during 2020, with 90% of initial releases made within 24 h of the initial request.Within the Emergency Response Framework, WHO’s operational response to emergencies during 2020 was coordinated in the Incident Management System structure, which is based on recognized best practices in emergency management and is increasingly used by emergency management systems globally, including in the health sector. The COVID-19 response dominated activities and resources in 2020, with interoperable incident management support teams established in WHO headquarters, all regional offices and all country offices, drawing on partner expertise through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. The initial rapid response to the emergence of COVID-19 was quickly followed by publication of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, which united a global coalition of partners behind a common set of objectives. At global level, meeting the challenge of COVID-19 meant bringing the entire United Nations system together in a coordinated response that reflects the full spectrum of its capabilities. WHO was at the forefront of coordination, leading the Crisis Management Team, which brings the collective strengths of 23 United Nations entities under one response umbrella. At national level, WHO played a facilitating and coordinating role through the COVID-19 Partners Platform, a mechanism to plan, resource and track implementation of national action plans by integrating United Nations country teams, implementing partners and donors.In all the pillars of the response to COVID-19, WHO scaled up and leveraged existing and new operational and partnership platforms to ensure that the Organization’s evidence-based technical knowledge was translated into tangible impacts at national and subnational levels. The WHO-led COVID-19 supply chain system is a perfect illustration of such end-to-end integration of technical and operational capacities for impact. From technical specifications and quality assurance by WHO’s technical experts through procurement and distribution through the logistics capabilities and joint purchasing power of WHO and partners, WHO procured and shipped more than US$ 1 billion of essential response supplies, including vital medical oxygen, personal protective equipment and more than 250 million COVID-19 tests to 184 countries during 2020. The Tech Science for Health network brought together multidisciplinary technical expertise and operational capacity to revolutionize the approach to designing and constructing emergency treatment facilities, enabling the establishment of 3659 treatment beds for patients with severe acute respiratory illness in 17 countries. Access to an emergency health workforce was coordinated through the Emergency Medical Teams initiative, which facilitated over 70 international medical support missions and provided technical standards and support for the mobilization of more than 800 national medical teams during 2020. In addition, WHO directly deployed hundreds of teams and missions to strengthen critical national and subnational responses to COVID-19.A large proportion of WHO’s direct support for the COVID-19 response and most operational support for all-hazard emergencies during 2020 was focused on contexts affected by fragility, conflict and violence. Meeting the health needs of populations in such contexts will be a key determinant of whether the world will achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The World Bank has estimated that, by 2030, up to two thirds of the world's extremely poor could live in such settings. The majority of preventable maternal and neonatal deaths and deaths from preventable infectious diseases occur in contexts affected by fragility, conflict and violence. Although the trend over the past several decades has been positive, the pace of improvement is not sufficient to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.Conflict, which has been increasing since 2010, accounts for 80% of humanitarian needs, and the complex interplay between conflict, climate change, rising inequality and demographic change is increasing fragility and vulnerability. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit populations in such settings especially hard. In addition, it has been especially difficult to conduct emergency response operations with health-sector partners because of the unprecedented scale and nature of the disruption caused by the pandemic, which has exacerbated pre-existing impediments to implementation such as limited humanitarian access, insufficient funding to ensure the delivery of sustainable, continuous life-saving health services to crisis-affected vulnerable populations, attacks on health care workers and facilities and escalating field costs.As the lead agency for health of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, WHO can operate in and access some of the most difficult-to-reach populations to ensure essential health services. During 2020, WHO led integration and delivery of the public health response to COVID-19 by implementing the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19, providing coordination and operational support in 30 countries, with 900 national and international partners, to meet the essential health needs of 90.8 million people.The response to COVID-19 has shown that the approach to delivering essential health services must evolve, with strengthening of resilience and health security. Strengthening of health systems as a means to achieve universal health coverage has been at the centre of WHO’s work for many years; however, it has not yet been effectively integrated with strengthening of preparedness, response and recovery capacities for health security. Chronic underinvestment in essential public health functions, in particular those relevant to IHR emergency risk management, has resulted in a pattern in which reactions to events that are recurrent and predictable come at high socio-economic cost, with inadequate investment in risk reduction and preparedness capacities that would reduce the negative impact of future events. Breaking this pattern of panic and neglect is especially urgent in settings of fragility, conflict and violence, where most epidemics occur and where there are additional hazards that periodically acutely exacerbate protracted emergencies. A better-integrated approach in such contexts, grounded in primary health care that builds trust with communities, would both ensure safe access to resilient health services and ensure that basic capacities for all-hazard emergency risk management are in place. Achieving this will require a new funding model for supporting fragile countries experiencing conflict and violence and sustainable core resources for WHO to maintain a country presence in order to deliver a consistent package of technical and operational support.To find progress on health outcome indicators, visit the World health statistics back Strengthening health systems to get to ‒ and stay at ‒ ZERO malaria cases Malaria eliminated in 10 countries in 5 yearsThe elimination target was set by the WHO global malaria strategy.

Today, the list serves as a tool to guide member countries' selection of medicines and policies against two major global crises: antibiotic resistance and the surge of cancers. When we face health and welfare calamities, the WHO model list can lead the way to strengthen human rights and health-based medicine policies.

However, with concrete concerted action to accelerate progress, a substantive subset of them could still be achieved. Achieving 1 Billion more people living with better health and well-being 1 215 million more people by 2023 exceeded 215 million people The outcome indicators for healthier populations are influenced by multisectoral policy actions to address the determinants of health. The current trajectory indicates that the target of 1 billion more people enjoying better health and well-being will likely be met by 2025, driven primarily by improvements in air quality and access to water, sanitation and hygiene measures (e.g. with respect to the particulate matter 2.5 standard, clean household fuels, safely managed sanitation). However, progress will be insufficient to reach all the health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, with only one target projected to be met (target 3.a. on tobacco use). For example, the prevalence of adult obesity continues to be on the rise in all WHO regions, with no immediate sign of reversal. Ambient air pollution continues to be a challenge in many areas of the world. There also continue to be challenges related to the limited availability of data on some outcome indicators included under this triple billion target, which in turn adds limitations to understanding the trajectory and impact of WHO’s work on health policy and health determinants (e.g. interpersonal violence and childhood development). First health day at the UN Climate Conference For the first time, a day was dedicated to health at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 28). More than 40 million health professionals joined the call to action by WHO and civil society organizations to prioritize health in governmental negotiations, aiming to expedite the phase-out of fossil fuels, and 149 countries signed the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate and Health. These groundbreaking initiatives, coordinated by the WHO Secretariat in partnership with key stakeholders, have elevated the political discourse and effectively integrated health considerations into the global climate change agenda. However, more ambitious action is needed to curb the countless deaths resulting from climate change and environmental pollution each year. The WHO Secretariat will provide support by guiding countries in reducing air pollution and implementing the COP26 commitments to build a climate-resilient, low-carbon and sustainable health system. 45 countries reduced their road traffic death by 30% or more in 10 years WHO reported that 45 countries reduced their road traffic deaths by 30% or more, despite a proliferation of motor vehicles, during the Decade of Action 2011–2020. The WHO Secretariat has established what works: political will to match the scale and urgency of the crisis combined with WHO best practice measures, such as laws on speed, drink-driving, seat belts, helmets and child car seats. For example, through a network of parliamentarians, the WHO Secretariat facilitated the adoption of the African Union’s Road Safety Charter in all but two countries. However, the decline in road traffic deaths falls far short of what is needed to halve road traffic fatalities by 2030. For its part, the WHO Secretariat is working with 30 high-mortality countries to stabilize and then reduce road traffic death rates by 2025. 53 countries have policies to eliminate trans fats Another 13 countries implemented best practice policies to eliminate industrially produced trans-fatty acids in the food supply during the biennium, bringing the total to 53 countries, 42 of which have done so since the WHO call for action was issued in 2018. The WHO Secretariat has provided standards and guidance through workshops to increase regulatory and laboratory capacities for developing and implementing trans-fatty acids regulations based on the REPLACE trans fat action package. For example, in 2023, regulatory training was provided in the Region of the Americas and the African Region, while China and Ukraine were supported through WHO laboratory protocols to conduct assessments of trans-fats with limited resources. Despite the progress made to date, more than half of the world’s population are still not covered by trans-fatty acids best practices in countries that together account for at least 90% of the total global trans-fatty acids burden. To drive progress further, the WHO Secretariat has started to to validate whether countries have a framework with a best practice policy as well as robust monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. 56 countries on track to reduce tobacco use Tobacco use is declining in 150 countries, 56 of which are on track to achieve the global target for reducing tobacco use by 2025. There are 19 million fewer current tobacco users globally than there were two years ago, while 151 countries are protected by at least one measure of the MPOWER technical package and 101 are protected by at least two measures. Member States are increasingly equipped to use fiscal measures to improve health, reduce health care costs and generate a revenue stream for development – thanks in part to increased technical support and updated guidance from the Secretariat; for example, more than 90 countries increased their tobacco excise tax between 2020 and 2022. However, only a 25% relative reduction in global tobacco use is projected for 2025, falling short of the 30% voluntary target agreed in the global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013–2020. While the prevalence of tobacco use among women is tracking towards a 40% relative reduction by 2025, the comparable reduction among men is currently too slow at 21%. For its part, the WHO Secretariat is working with more than 40 countries to strengthen tobacco control policies at the highest level in order to reduce tobacco use. 178 countries have action plans on antimicrobial resistance An additional 29 countries developed multisectoral national action plans on antimicrobial resistance during the biennium 2022–2023, bringing the total to 178 countries, while the number of countries reporting data on resistant infections has more than tripled in the last seven years. These data and plans provide the basis for countries to address the resistance to life-saving antimicrobial medicines. The WHO Secretariat supports countries in reporting data to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System and to Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance Country Self-Assessment Surveys; it also provides technical assistance and guidance products such as a core package of people-centred interventions and the WHO AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) antibiotic book. Support is also provided to countries to promote increased community engagement, such as the Communities Empowered to Tackle Antimicrobial Resistance initiative in the Americas. However, only 11% of countries have dedicated national budgets for implementing their national action plans, highlighting the need for enhanced commitments at the United Nations General Assembly high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance to be held in September 2024. Achieving 1 Billion more people benefiting from Universal Health Coverage 429 million more people by 2023 Shortfall 571 million people The world is off track to meet the target of 1 billion more people benefiting from universal health coverage by 2025 and to meet the related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. However, 30% of countries have bucked the global trend and are making progress on both the coverage of essential health services and the provision of financial protection. The overall measures of progress are largely driven by increased HIV service coverage. The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to many indicators, such as those on routine childhood vaccination and tuberculosis, are recovering .but still require concerted effort to close the gaps and accelerate action towards the Sustainable Development Goals . For example, the number of zero-dose children improved in 2022, falling to 14.3 million compared with 18.1 million in 2021, although it did not fall back to the pre-pandemic 2019 level of 12.9 million. However, service coverage for malaria, noncommunicable and other diseases and preventive services continue to lag, while the indicators for financial hardship and management of diabetes have worsened. Reduction in mortality after implementation of WHO toolkit A study has shown a 34% to 50% reduction in mortality from acute conditions in hospitals in Nepal, Uganda and Zambia following the implementation of WHO emergency care tools and the Basic Emergency Care course that was developed by the World Health Organization, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation for Emergency Medicine. This toolkit has been implemented by the WHO, nongovernmental organization partners, governments and universities in more than 60 countries. Some countries have incorporated Basic Emergency Care training into local curricula, such as in Costa Rica where it is now a requirement for nursing and medical undergraduates. The study period ranged from 10 to 24 months and the results suggest a reduction in mortality due to pneumonia, diarrhoea, asthma, postpartum haemorrhage, road traffic injury and diabetic crisis (ketoacidosis), suggesting that the toolkit will impact multiple Sustainable Development Goals targets, including those related to under 5 and maternal mortality rates, deaths from noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries, and deaths attributable to air pollution and unsafe water and sanitation. The Basic Emergency Care 25x25 initiative for nurses and midwives will bring this intervention to scale in 25 countries by 2025, with additional expansion through the WHO Acute Care Action Network. Record numbers receive tuberculosis treatment In 2022, the first-ever all-oral treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were made available, greatly reducing treatment times and improving the quality of life for people with multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. WHO introduced guidelines recommending the use of the new all-oral treatment regimens, contributing to uptake in 109 countries. More than 7.5 million people with tuberculosis received access to diagnosis and treatment – the highest since monitoring begun almost 30 years ago. However, incidence remains high and off-target. The WHO Secretariat supported 16 of the countries most disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic to get back on track towards the End TB Strategy targets. During 2023, a Member States high-level meeting at the United Nations General Assembly political declaration gave a commitment to ensure that at least 90% of those who develop tuberculosis will be treated and at least 90% of those at risk of the disease will be provided with preventive treatment. Supply constraints resolved with 2 malaria vaccines During the biennium, the world’s first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, has been administered to 2 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi, resulting in a vaccine-attributable 13% drop in all-cause mortality among children who are age-eligible for vaccination. During the biennium 2022–2023, WHO also issued prequalification approval for a second vaccine, R21/Matrix-M, and recommended its use in children. The availability of the two vaccines resolves supply constraints and 20 countries have been approved for the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance in introducing the vaccine as a part of their comprehensive malaria control plans. During the biennium 2022–2023, an additional three countries were certified malaria-free by WHO: Azerbaijan, Belize and Tajikistan. When implemented broadly, malaria vaccines are expected to save tens of thousands of lives a year. For its part, the WHO Secretariat is working to support 26 high-burden malaria countries to be on track for achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals targets by 2025. An AIDS-free generation is possible More than 75% of people living with HIV globally are receiving antiretroviral therapy and almost all of those who are receiving treatment are achieving viral suppression, which means that they cannot infect others. The uptake of WHO guidance has been strong: 150 countries use WHO recommendations on pre-exposure prophylaxis in their national guidelines; 63 countries have routinely implemented national policies supporting HIV self-testing; 116 countries have adopted WHO-preferred first-line antiretroviral therapy for adults and adolescents; and 98 countries have implemented routine data viral load monitoring for adults and adolescents. We are now beginning to see a path towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals target of ending the HIV epidemic: six countries have achieved the “95-95-95” goals for the control of HIV and an additional 16 countries are close to doing so, while Botswana became the first high-burden country to be certified by WHO for, among other things, achieving an HIV case rate of fewer than 500 per 100 000 live births. This demonstrates that an AIDS-free generation is possible. 14 countries eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease A total of 14 countries eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease during the biennium 2022–2023:- the Democratic Republic of the Congo eliminated dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease);- Benin, Iraq, Malawi, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Togo and Vanuatu eliminated trachoma;- Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Rwanda and Uganda eliminated African trypanosomiasis; and - Bangladesh and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic eliminated lymphatic filariasis. In addition, Bangladesh became the first country in the world to eliminate visceral leishmaniasis, thanks to a collaboration including the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical DiseasesThis brings to 50 the number of countries acknowledged by WHO as having eliminated a neglected tropical disease, marking the halfway point to the 100-country target set for 2030. Sustained political commitment remains critical to achieving the target. Projected workforce shortage in 2030 reduced The 2022 rounded estimates indicate a reduction in the projected global health workforce shortage from the earlier estimate of 18 million to 10 million by 2030, based on current trends (mostly depicting a pre-COVID-19 pandemic situation). However, there are a number of regional variations; for example, the African and the Eastern Mediterranean regions will have an increasing share of the total health workforce shortage in 2030. The implementation of the National Health Workforce Accounts system has increased progressively since its inception in 2016; it offers a standardized measurement approach to workforce indicators and human resources for health information systems strengthening and was used by 176 countries in 2023. Looking ahead, the WHO Secretariat is working to support countries, particularly those that will bear an increasing share of the total health workforce shortage in 2030, to stimulate investments in workforce education and employment. Managing hypertension with WHO HEARTS An additional seven million people are under treatment for hypertension through application of the WHO HEARTS’ simple, algorithmic approach. The WHO Secretariat reported that improving global blood pressure control from the current level of 23% to 50% or more would avert 76 million cardiovascular deaths, 120 million strokes, 79 million myocardial infarctions, and 17 million cases of heart failure between 2023 and 2050. In addition, WHO developed and promoted the WHO HEARTS’ simple, algorithmic approach to cardiovascular disease management in primary health care. However, more efforts are needed to reach the 1 in 3 adults worldwide affected by hypertension. Kits provide essential NCD medicines during emergencies Since 2017, more than 142 000 WHO noncommunicable disease kits have been distributed to 28 countries, territories and areas affected by conflicts and/or natural disasters and placed in humanitarian hubs – including South Sudan, Ukraine and Gaza Strip and West Bank – and making it one of the most purchased emergency kits. Direct technical and financial support to preserve or restore essential NCDs essential services during acute emergencies is part of this response, including through the deployment of WHO NCD emergency kit, an essential set of medicines and supplies for the management diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and other NCDs. Each kit provides affordable, safe and dependable access to lifesaving NCD medicines and supplies for 10 000 people for over three months. However, people affected by humanitarian emergencies are at increased risk of noncommunicable diseases, with 1 in 23 of the world’s population in need of humanitarian assistance in 2023. Achieving 1 Billion more people protected from health emergencies 599 million more people by 2023 Shortfall 401 million people Global progress is not on track to reach the target of 1 billion more people better protected from health emergencies by 2025. Improvements in preparedness, as measured through core capacities related to the International Health Regulations (2005), made a positive contribution in 2022–2023. Although the coverage of vaccinations for high-priority pathogens shows improvement relative to the COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions in 2020–2021, it has not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels. Efforts are continuing to assess the best way to measure protection from health emergencies, including through the integration of timeliness targets for detection, notification and response to health emergencies. International instruments progress The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB) advanced in drafting a WHO Pandemic Agreement, while the Working Group on Amendments to the International Health Regulations (2005) focused on key amendments to enhance the existing regulations. The aim is for the outcomes of these negotiations to be submitted for consideration by the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly. Pandemic Fund disbursed US$ 338 million to 37 countries in 2023 The Pandemic Fund made its first round of disbursements – amounting to US$ 338 million – to 37 countries in 2023. The creation of the Fund in 2022 marked an important change in the world’s commitment to providing dedicated, long-term financing to strengthen prevention, preparedness and response capacities at the country and community levels. As an accredited implementing entity, WHO distributed US$ 159 million – almost half of the approved projects for the first round of disbursements. In addition, WHO continues to host the secretariat of the G20 Joint Finance and Health Task Force and to lead efforts to identify gaps in preparedness and financing and to work with partners to strengthen mechanism to close these gaps. The WHO Secretariat is working to increase preparedness for emergencies in all countries, as measured through International Health Regulations (2005) States Parties self-assessment annual reporting, and to support countries through the grant management process for the Pandemic Fund. Increased genomic sequencing capability for SARS-CoV-2 There has been a 62% increase (from 103 to 167) in the proportion of Member States with genomic sequencing capability for SARS-CoV-2 between February 2021 and December 2023. Angola, Bahamas, Central African Republic, Dominican Republic, Honduras, Maldives and Sudan are among the countries that have gained a sequencing capacity. The WHO Secretariat has supported countries in all six regions to develop national genomic surveillance strategies, policies, programmes and, in 2023, five countries (Ghana, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Namibia and Oman) costed their sequencing programmes using the global genomics costing tool co-developed by WHO and four partner agencies. Launched in May 2023, the International Pathogen Surveillance Network aims to collaboratively solve common challenges in pathogen genomics, accelerate progress on the deployment of pathogen genomic surveillance and improve public health decision-making. This initiative is in line with the WHO global genomic surveillance strategy for pathogens with pandemic and epidemic potential 2022–2032, which aims for all WHO Member States to have timely access to a genomic sequencing capability. Further collaborative investments in foundational laboratory and surveillance systems are needed by WHO Member States and partner organizations. Equitable access to licensed vaccines during outbreaks In 2023, - 62 million persons were protected for life from yellow fever via campaigns and an additional 17.4 million children protected via routine immunization in Africa; - 1.4 million people were vaccinated against meningitis in response to outbreaks of Meningococcus C in Niger and Nigeria, and 1.5 million were vaccinated preventively against Meningococcus A in Cameroon; - 127 000 doses of Ebola vaccines with a short shelf-life were repurposed to preventatively vaccinate health care and frontline workers in three at-risk countries as no Ebola virus disease outbreaks were reported; and - 36 million of the 74 million doses of the oral cholera vaccine requested by 14 countries were provided. WHO hosts the Secretariat of the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision for cholera, meningitis, yellow fever and Ebola virus disease, working with partners to make available and ensure equitable access to licensed vaccines during outbreaks. During the biennium, 5 million doses of the newly prequalified pentavalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine were secured for the stockpile for use in future. The WHO Secretariat anticipates that the production of the oral cholera vaccine could rise from 37 million doses to 52 million doses in 2024 if a simplified formulation is prequalified, which would contribute to completing the restoration of vaccine coverage of at-risk groups for epidemic- and pandemic-prone diseases to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Reaching remaining unvaccinated children Intensified polio eradication efforts are reaching the remaining unvaccinated children in a handful of districts in Pakistan and Afghanistan – the only areas with endemic wild polio in the world. The WHO Secretariat coordinated the administration of more than 800 million vaccinations in more than 30 countries in 2023, while a concerted subregional emergency response across five neighbouring countries in south-east Africa arrested the transmission of the wild poliovirus after an outbreak in early 2022.Gender analysis is a fundamental practice of the WHO Secretariat in formulating tailored, gender-responsive plans. Female health workers play a crucial role in facilitating access to households and raising awareness among female caregivers. Despite setbacks due to ongoing poliovirus outbreaks, the African Region pursues a phased approach for seamless transition of the Region’s polio assets, tools and knowledge to sustain the critical functions related to immunization, disease surveillance and emergency response. The Eastern Mediterranean Region has developed an investment case that shows a high return on investment in sustaining the polio infrastructure. In the South-East Asia Region, the focus is on utilizing the integrated networks to reach zero-dose children. The WHO commitment of US$ 33.2 million funding from the core voluntary contributions account has been catalytic to sustaining the essential polio functions through integration and ensuring their long-term sustainability in more than 50 countries that transitioned their crucial infrastructure from a reliance on resources through the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Steep increase in humanitarian health needs on a global scale The Contingency Fund for Emergencies released funding, in as little as 24 hours, to 22 graded emergencies in 2023, in line with WHO’s Emergency Response Framework. In 2023, the amount of US$ 79 million was released to fund the initial response to acute events and scale up life-saving health operations in protracted crises in response to escalating needs. As part of WHO’s core functions related to preparing for and responding to health emergencies, especially in crisis-affected settings, the Organization worked closely with partners to support the efforts of national governments to increase the quality and coverage of health services; strengthen primary, secondary and hospital health care by deploying mobile teams and reinforcing health facilities; improve public health surveillance and early warning systems, as well as other systems for actionable health information; conduct vaccination campaigns; distribute medicines and supplies; and train health workers; and scale up mental health and psychosocial support services. For example WHO provided scaled-up mental health and psychosocial support services to 2 million people in the Syrian Arab Republic and Türkiye following earthquakes, as well as the deployment of mental health and psychosocial support experts to 12 complex emergency countries, including Ukraine. There has been a steep increase in humanitarian health needs on a global scale, driven by overlapping and interacting aggravating factors, including the accelerating effects of climate change, increased conflict and insecurity, increasing food insecurity, weakened health systems in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic downturns and new infectious disease outbreaks. A more effective and efficient WHO providing better support to countries Streamlined availability of health data The launch of the World Health Data Hub improved data availability through deeper partnerships with countries, experts and organizations to reduce data fragmentation and improve timeliness, usability and efficiency. The World Health Data Hub is becoming the central location for global, regional and country data on the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. A country portal is simplifying country reporting and facilitating efficient communication among all levels of WHO. Delivery for impact The Delivery for Impact approach is bringing a new approach to efficiency and accountability, accelerating progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals and the Triple Billion targets using structured planning and rigorous stock-takes. More than 50 countries have used the delivery for impact approach to set priorities and accelerate progress by implementing evidence-based policy solutions. Digital public goods in health More than 70 countries at all levels of income are connected to the Global Digital Health Certification Network, which is essential to support person-centred health systems and verification of health documents across national and international borders. WHO is uniquely positioned as the global technical agency in health to develop, host and maintain digital public goods, such as the digital International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis for diseases covered under the International Health Regulations (2005) – known as the yellow card – as well as e-prescriptions and health worker credentials. While over 120 Member States have established digital health strategies aligned with the WHO global strategy on digital health 2020-2025, challenges remain with respect to the financing and implementation of those strategies. To address this, the Global Initiative on Digital Health was launched with the aim to amplify and align resources toward country-led digital health transformation that strengthens digital public infrastructure, governance and institutional capacity. Safeguarding political commitments Member States agreed on a path towards a sustainably financed WHO, both through increasing assessed contributions and holding an investment round to encourage more predictable, flexible funding, as well as by broadening the donor base to increase resilience. In 2022, through decision WHA75(8), the Health Assembly adopted the historic recommendation of the Working Group on Sustainable Financing for the Secretariat to develop budget proposals for an increase of assessed contributions with a view to reaching a level of 50% of the 2022–2023 base budget by the biennium 2030–2031. In 2023, Member States approved to go ahead with the planning of the first investment round, which provides an opportunity to rally all stakeholders around the draft Fourteenth General Programme of Work, 2025–2028 (GPW 14) and turn the tide on achieving the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages). It aims to safeguard the political commitment to global health and to WHO, and seeks commitments to fully fund the draft GPW 14 by increasing the flexibility and predictability of WHO’s financing – ultimately striving to achieve the recommendation of the Working Group on Sustainable Financing that the base segment of the programme budget should be fully flexibly funded. 58 countries respond to DG’s “call to action” Following the Director-General’s “call to action” to eliminate cervical cancer, an additional 25 countries have introduced the human papillomavirus vaccine, bringing the total to 58 countries that have introduced the vaccine since WHO launched the initiative in 2020. For its part, the WHO Secretariat provided technical support for the introduction of the vaccine and, following new WHO guidance on schedule optimization in 2022, supported countries with decision-making on switching to a single-dose regimen. A total of 37 countries adopted the single-dose policy, thereby simplifying vaccine delivery and reducing resource needs for both introducing and sustaining the vaccination process. In the biennium 2024–2025, WHO will continue working with countries to improve vaccination, screening and treatment coverage. Transforming silence around sexual misconduct A threefold increase in reports of sexual misconduct and massive engagement of the workforce in discussing this topic resulted from WHO’s efforts to transform the silence around the topic to a speak-up culture during the biennium 2022–2023. WHO launched victim-centred policies; clarified accountability; invested in funds and people; established a dedicated investigation team; established the regular publication of data on allegations and disciplinary action; established a global network; and made annual sexual misconduct risk assessments mandatory in all country offices. While global standards currently focus on processes, WHO is working with the United Nations to define and deliver meaningful results for lasting institutional change. Gender equality and disability inclusion WHO’s performance in meeting or exceeding the requirements for indicators in the United Nations system-wide action plan for gender equality and the empowerment of women increased from 47% in 2021 to 81% in 2023. The Organization has also made progress on the indicators of the United Nations Disability Inclusion Strategy. In 2023, WHO’s performance was mainly considered to approach or meet the requirements for disability inclusion indicators, although performance in respect of those for leadership, policy/strategy, institutional setup and joint initiatives exceeded requirements. PROGRAMME BUDGET FUNDING AND IMPLEMENTATIONThe biennium 2022–2023 saw high levels of financing of both the total revised Programme budget 2022–2023 (US$ 8.4 billion (see Table 1), US$ 0.5 billion higher than in 2020–2021) and the base segment of the budget (US$ 4.4 billion, US$ 0.6 billion higher than in 2020–2021). The funds available in the biennium 2022–2023 at country office level exceeded the amounts received in the biennium 2020-2021, both for the total Programme budget and for the base segment. The country office level received the largest share of the three levels of Organization in all types of funds (voluntary specified, voluntary thematic and flexible). Although the percentage implementation of the revised base Programme budget 2022–2023 (79%) was lower than in 2020–2021, the absolute implementation was US$ 0.7 billion more in the biennium 2022–2023. Voluntary contributions (specified and thematic) represented 58% of total financing for base programmes in 2022–2023. The high level of earmarking of many of these contributions made it challenging for the Organization to strategically allocate funding as needed and a number of areas of underfunding persisted as a result in 2022–2023, especially under strategic priorities 1 and 3. In addition, funding in the amount of US$ 1.14 billion was received between July and November 2023, representing 17% of the total revenue funds, which arrived too late to be fully implemented by the end of the biennium 2022–2023. Predictable, flexible and earlier arrival of funds would contribute to better planning, as well as better allocation to the three levels of the Organization and more timely implementation. The Secretariat greatly appreciates the generosity of Member States and other stakeholders for the amount of financing achieved and notes the importance of maintaining and increasing the flexibility and predictability of the funds allocated to the Organization, and of strengthening the financing of the Organization’s core work as approved in WHO’s base programmes.The below dashboards present details of Programme budget funding and implementation across the 4 budget segments.Programme budget 2022–2023 and its financing and expenditures, by segment, as at 31 December 2023 (US$ million)SegmentApproved Programme budget 2022-2023(US$ million)Financing(US$ million)Financing as % of approved budget Expenditures (US$ million)Expenditures as % of approved budget Base programmes4 9684 39088%3 90579%Polio eradication5581 098197%1 050188%Special programmes19915377%12261%Emergency operations and appeals1 0002 755275%2 312231%Total6 7268 3957 390 Detailed view on programme funding and implementation Select budget segmentOverviewBase programmesEmergency operation and appealsPolio eradicationSpecial Programmes What is the budget's performance?

Challenges and looking forwardIn the new biennium for 2024–2025, the Secretariat will continue to balance its investment in the normative functions of the Organization with the criticality of strengthening country office capacities, specifically by funding 80% of the planned budget of high-priority outputs, thereby accelerating progress towards meeting the triple billion targets of the GPW 13.During the biennium 2024–2025, it will also be important for Member States to maintain the momentum for a sustainably financed Organization with two core decision points: the WHO investment round to be convened in November 2024; and the next step in increasing the assessed contributions to 50% of base segment of the programme budget by 2030, always with the objective of increasing the predictability and flexibility of funding and eliminating the pockets of poverty that have been persistent and problematic in the past.The WHO Secretariat will continue to implement the reform agenda as set out in the Agile Member States Task Group recommendations and the Secretariat Implementation Plan on Reform, with a focus on continued outreach to new contributors, increased flexibility of funding, and increased transparency and accountability with respect to the use of funds, recognizing however that a sustainably financed Organization is the joint responsibility of the Secretariat and Member States.Moving beyond the GPW 13 and in light of the inconsistent progress made to date towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, the Secretariat together with the Member States prepared the draft Fourteenth General Programme of Work, building on lessons learned from the GPW 13 and realigning our focus to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

WHO’s strategy, the Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019–2023 (GPW 13) focuses on delivering measurable improvements to health in all countries. The Executive Board recommended the extension of the period of the GPW 13 from 2023 to 2025. In GPW 13, WHO set triple billion targets for healthier populations, universal health coverage and health emergencies (one billion more people enjoying better health and well-being, one billion more people benefitting from universal health coverage, and one billion people better protected from health emergencies by 2023), based on the Sustainable Development Goals. It also defined how WHO will help countries attain the targets through leadership, global public health goods and technical products, and country support. The GPW 13 triple billion targets continue to be a powerful force to drive and deliver change. They provide a unified approach to achieving the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and contribute to improvements in healthy life expectancy.This report marks five years since WHO set out to enhance its focus on measurable impacts in countries. During this time, the Organization set measurable triple billion targets based on the Sustainable Development Goals; established a results framework to measure country progress and identify the contribution of the WHO Secretariat; reported annually using the framework; launched delivery stock takes to track progress and identify ways for WHO to support countries on specific indicators; developed and revised the first WHO investment case; and continue to help countries accelerate progress through scaling innovation, innovative finance, and strengthening collaboration among multilateral agencies.This results report for the biennium 2020–2021 presents the progress towards the triple billion targets, outcomes and outputs, based on the GPW 13 results framework and indicators. It uses structured methodologies, both quantitative and qualitative, for measuring and analysing the achievements and challenges to achieving them, and includes country and impact case studies to exemplify how the Organization’s work is driving health impacts at the country level, where it matters most. For the first time, the WHO Secretariat is reporting on its investments, results and performance through a scorecard methodology for every country or territory it serves.WHO’s overall goal is to continuously improve its accountability for results. This generates trust on the part of those it serves and those who support WHO, and creates a virtuous circle reinforcing WHO’s Constitutional leadership function “to act as the directing and coordinating authority on international health work.”See the detailed results report in this link: https://www.who.int/about/accountability/results/who-results-report-2020-2021 Progress on the triple billion and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The world was off track to reach most of the triple billion targets and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and it is even further off track now.Healthier populations: Although the billion target is projected to be almost reached by 2023, progress is about one quarter of that required to reach the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, estimates suggested that 900 million more people would be enjoying better health and well-being in 2023 compared to the 2018 baseline. Current progress reflects improvements made in access to clean household fuels, safe water and sanitation (WASH), and tobacco control. In other areas like obesity and malnutrition, the situation is stagnant or even worsening. Looking ahead, we now know that to achieve the health-related Sustainable Development Goals, the target needs to be almost 4 billion people reached for every 5-year period. To achieve this, more focus is being placed on leading indicators for premature mortality and morbidity, such as tobacco, air pollution, road injuries and obesity, which are key levers for increasing healthier lives. Additionally, attention to inequalities between and within countries will be critical, since 80% of the progress in this target to date has been driven by only a handful of countries. To achieve global targets and health for all, it is necessary to ensure that efforts are sustained and that evidence-based policy solutions are not only produced but also are being implemented and driving action in countries.WHO Blink Media – Fabeha Monir - Bangladesh Cox Bazaar Covid reponseUniversal health coverage: The billion target will not be reached by 2023, and progress is less than one quarter of that needed to reach the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Current estimates suggest that without course correction, we will fall short by 730 million people of reaching 1 billion more people with universal health coverage in 2023. WHO pulse surveys on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic reported that 94% of countries experienced disruption to essential health services, which increases the shortfall to 840 million. Overall, progress is still being made with average service coverage improving in most countries; but concerted efforts to meet service delivery targets in specific areas like HIV treatment, childhood immunization and blood pressure control would help to reduce the current gap in reaching the billion target by nearly half. Attention to financial hardship due to health-related spending is also timelier than ever. Over the past two decades, 92 countries have experienced little change or worsening trends in financial protection – which is now exacerbated by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Taking action on recommended policies to minimize fragmented approaches to coverage, establishing universal guarantees focused on high priority health services, and establishing budgetary measures to ensure funds flow to these services, can accelerate progress in both financial protection and service coverage. Primary health care, with its focus on multisectoral action, integrated health services, community empowerment and strengthening overall health systems functions, is an important avenue towards realizing universal health coverage.WHO Henitsoa Rafalia - Madagascar Cyclone Batsirai ResponseHealth emergencies protection: Although initial projections anticipated that the billion target for health emergencies protection could be met by 2023, COVID-19 has revealed that no country is fully prepared for a pandemic of such scale. The Prepare indicator shows that country-level preparedness capacities have increased since the 2018 baseline. However, COVID-19 highlighted limitations in current metrics and has prompted the evolution of assessment methods and systematic processes to ensure they are more predictive, dynamic and holistic. Some activities central to health emergencies protection have been disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with the Prevent indicator showing more countries experiencing decrease in vaccine coverage for priority pathogens than in the previous year. Equitable access, prevention strategies, and catch-up vaccination efforts must be prioritized, scaled up and accelerated so that coverage does not further decline. The Detect, Notify and Respond indicator shows a different trend: that countries improved the timeliness for detecting events and strengthened critical public health functions such as surveillance. These gains and investments need to be sustained and expanded to cover an increasing number of emergencies. Protecting people in fragile, conflict-affected and vulnerable settings who are disproportionately affected by health emergencies is also critical to ensure that no one is left behind. WHO is working with Member States and partners to act on recent reviews, recommendations and resolutions so that the COVID-19 pandemic is the last of its kind. WHO YemenHighlighted accomplishmentsSince January 2020 WHO has led the global community against the surge of the pandemic, with an unrelenting focus on global health equity. Through weekly meetings of Member States to share good practices, weekly press conferences with the world’s media to discuss recent trends and public health guidance, and partnerships such as the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), COVID-19 Technology Access Partnership and technology transfer hubs, WHO has been a powerful voice for health equity in a world where equity gaps were widening and solidarity was strained.In mid-January 2022, ACT-A delivered its one-billionth COVID-19 vaccine dose, alongside 110 million diagnostic tests. In addition, US$4.8 million was delivered to countries in therapeutics, US$ 187 million in oxygen supplies, and US$ 499 million in personal protective equipment. Unfortunately, the world is not on track for WHO’s target of each country vaccinating 70% of its population by July 2022.WHO gave emergency use listing to 10 types of COVID-19 vaccine, the first of these on the last day of 2020. Within only 15 days of WHO listing the vaccines for emergency use, 101 countries had issued national regulatory authorization, basing their decisions of WHO risk-based assessment and accelerating vaccine roll-out.WHO recommended widespread use of the world’s first malaria vaccine (RTS,S) among children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission. The recommendation is based on the results of an ongoing pilot programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi that has reached more than 1 million children since 2019. Using this vaccine alongside existing tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year. WHO Abdelrahman – JordanFifteen countries have eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. There has been a large-scale expansion in HIV treatment – 85% of pregnant women living with HIV are receiving antiretroviral therapy, leading to fewer paediatric infections. Botswana, the first high-burden country to achieve “Silver Tier” certification, embarked on an aggressive programme to prevent mother-to child transmission in 1999, when HIV prevalence was as high as 30%.Mandatory policies prohibiting the use of trans fatty acids are now in effect for 3.2 billion people in 58 countries. Among these countries, 40 have best practice policies (including Brazil, Peru, Singapore, Turkey and the United Kingdom in 2021). WHO’s REPLACE initiative aims for a world free of trans-fats by the end of 2023. WHO estimates that every year, trans-fat intake leads to more than 500 000 people dying from cardiovascular disease.Almost two-thirds of the world’s population is protected by at least one tobacco control measure outlined in WHO’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In addition, 60 countries are on track to achieve the global target of a 30% reduction in tobacco use from 2010 to 2025 – double the number from two years ago.On polio eradication, six children were paralysed by wild poliovirus in 2021, the lowest number ever achieved. This is a decrease from 140 children paralysed by wild poliovirus in 2020; and so far in 2022, three children have been paralysed by wild poliovirus. In November, the first truly nationwide polio vaccination programme in several years was conducted in Afghanistan, protecting more than 2.6 million previously inaccessible children. WHO is a lead operational partner in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.In addition to these highlights, many other important accomplishments are listed systematically in the full results report under the 12 outcomes included in the report for universal health coverage, healthier populations, health emergencies and a stronger WHO. Programme Budget Financing and implementation In May 2019, the Seventy-second World Health Assembly adopted the WHO Programme budget 2020–2021 (resolution WHA72.1) in the amount of US$ 5840.4 million. This was the first programme budget under GPW 13. The biennium 2020–2021 saw both high levels of financing (US $7916 million) and implementation (US $6640 million) across the Organization. This represented an increase of 34% in financing and 25% in implementation compared with 2018–2019 (US$ 5913 million and US$ 5316 million, respectively). Overall financing also exceeded 100% of the approved budget for all major offices. The country level received the largest share of funds for implementation (US $4.3 billion, or 57% of total funds available) in 2020–2021.

Throughout the biennium WHO focused financing on outcomes defined as priorities by Member States (as detailed in document A72/INF/2). For country offices where information on prioritization was available, the outcomes classified as a high priority were allocated 87% of the total budget and 86% of the resources distributed to technical outcomes; and 50% of these priority outcomes reached over 75% financing.The large financing achieved in 2020–2021 has only been possible thanks to the generosity of Member States and other donors. Main donors contributed approximately 73% of the total financing in 2020–2021.The largest share of WHO financing remains specified voluntary contributions. Flexible funds constituted 20% of total financing in 2020–2021.These funds have been strategically used to address needs throughout the base segment of the programme budget, and efforts continue to improve internal allocation of resources. Nevertheless, the total gap in financing of the organizational budget centres at output level was approximately US $600 million at the end of the biennium. As reiterated within the discussions of the Working Group on Sustainable Financing , if flexible and thematic funds remain a lesser proportion of resources available, improving allocation of resources can succeed only to a limited extent. Overall implementation exceeded approved amounts of the total Programme budget 2020-2021 by 14% because of the emergency operations to respond to the pandemic. The implementation level of the base programmes was 85%, the same level as in 2018–2019. For more details on the financing and implementation of the Programme budget 2020–2021, please visit the budget section of the results report.Challenges and looking forwardThis results report and earlier ones serve as the foundation for WHO’s accountability for results. As we look forward, the big goals are recovering progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals and pandemic preparedness. To achieve these goals, WHO will focus on five priorities: (1) to support countries to make a radical shift towards promoting health and well-being and preventing disease by addressing its root causes; (2) to support a reorientation of health systems towards primary health care as the foundation of universal health coverage; (3) to strengthen the capacities, systems and tools for health emergency preparedness, response and resilience at all levels, underpinned by strong governance and financing and coordinated globally by WHO; (4) to harness the power of science, research innovation, data and digital technologies as critical enablers of the other priorities; and (5) to empower WHO as the directing and coordinating authority on global health, at the centre of the global health architecture. The challenge will be to accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals by translating these priorities into actions and results. This will require further strengthening the support provided by the WHO Secretariat to countries. In the past 5 years, WHO has laid the foundations for GPW 13’s focus on impact in countries. In the coming years, WHO must build on these foundations and fully execute on what it takes to become an impact-driven organization. This will require a sustainably financed WHO at the centre of the multilateral system in health. Indeed, results reporting and sustainable finance are inextricably interconnected: delivering results generates the confidence needed to increase sustainable finance. Only by creating this virtuous circle will the world achieve the triple billion targets and accelerate recovery towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, so that all people everywhere can enjoy better health.WHO Yoshi Shimizu – FijiSee the detailed results report in this link:https://www.who.int/about/accountability/results/who-results-report-2020-2021 Regions Africa Americas Eastern Mediterranean Europe South-East Asia Western Pacific Policies Cybersecurity Ethics Information disclosure Permissions and licensing Preventing sexual exploitation Terms of use About us Careers Frequently asked questions Library Newsletters Procurement Publications Contact us Report misconduct Privacy policy © 2024 WHO",

The past seven and a half decades have seen extraordinary progress in protecting people from diseases, health risks and harms. However, as this report shows, further progress is needed to achieve the triple billion targets towards attaining the health-related Sustainable Development Goals and meeting other health challenges, such as mental health, antimicrobial resistance and climate change. Five years ago WHO set out to enhance its focus on measurable impacts in countries, with the Thirteenth General Programme of Work, 2019–2023 (GPW 13), which was subsequently extended to 2025. During this time, the Organization set measurable triple billion targets based on the Sustainable Development Goals; established a results framework to measure country progress and identify the contribution of the Secretariat; reported annually using the framework; launched delivery stock takes to track progress and identify ways for the Secretariat to provide support to countries using specific indicators; developed and revised the first WHO investment case; and continue to help countries to accelerate progress through scaling up innovation, innovative financing, and strengthening collaboration among multilateral agencies. This mid-term review of implementation of the Programme budget 2022–2023 presents the progress in 2022 towards the triple billion targets, outcomes and outputs, based on the GPW 13 results framework, which includes indicators. As various evaluations have recommended simplifying the output monitoring process, this report includes progress on deliverables planned for the biennium with the main results that have emerged in the first year of the biennium as reported by the output delivery teams, leaving the more extensive programmatic assessment using the output scorecard for the end of biennium. In addition, key accomplishments are highlighted based on a selection by senior management and selected impact case studies are presented to exemplify how the Secretariat and Member States work together to drive health impacts at the country level, where it matters most. Progress on the triple billion targets and the sustainable development goals The world is off track to reach most of the triple billion targets and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals. Urgent action is needed to accelerate progress, or the world may fall further off track.Achieving 1 Billion more people living with better health and well-being1.26 Billion more people by 2023exceeded 260 million people The indicators for healthier populations are influenced by multisectoral policy actions to address determinants of health. Substantial progress has been made, and the current trajectory indicates that this target will likely be met by 2025; however, this will be insufficient progress to be on track to reach the related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. For example, the global age-standardized prevalence of tobacco use remains high. The prevalence of adult obesity continues to be on the rise in all WHO regions, with no immediate sign of reversal. Air pollution has not been tackled in many areas of the world. Data from the pandemic period continue to be sparse, so the full extent of the impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on various health determinants and policies is not yet quantified. Achieving 1 Billion more people benefiting from universal health coverage477 million more people by 2023shortfall 523 The world is off track to meet the universal health coverage billion target by 2025 and related Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. The disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on many indicators, only some of which are recovering. Overall measures of progress are largely driven by increased HIV service coverage. Service coverage for routine childhood vaccination, malaria, tuberculosis, noncommunicable and other diseases and preventive services all continue to lag, while indicators for financial hardship have worsened.Achieving 1 Billion more people better protected from health emergencies690 million more people by 2023shortfall 310 Progress in health emergencies protection is not on track to reach the billion target by 2025. Improvement in preparedness, measured through core capacities related to the International Health Regulations (2005) and reflected by the Prepare indicator, contributed positively in 2022. However, pandemic-related disruptions to high-priority pathogen vaccination programmes, measured under the Prevent indicator, need to be resolved. Efforts are continuing in order to assess the best way to measure health emergencies protection, including the integration of timeliness targets for detection, notification and response to health emergencies.Triple Billion Dashboard - WHO Feature storiesGroundbreaking achievements in long-standing areas of work and present day challengesWHO at 75 years: Combatting 21st century health challenges Read more Rapid reaction: aiming for the “golden hour” of health emergency response Read more More countries using health taxes and laws to protect health Read more Highlighted AchievementsThe first-ever all-oral treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis were made available. The Secretariat developed and introduced guidelines recommending the use of the new, all-oral treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, thereby contributing to its uptake in 109 countries. A reduction in treatment time from 18 months to 6 months significantly improves the quality of life for people with multidrug- and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis. The world’s first malaria vaccine, RTS,S/AS01, has been administered to 1.2 million children in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi through continuing pilot programmes, resulting in a substantial drop (an estimated 30%) in admissions of children with severe malaria to hospital and an important decline in child deaths (a 10% fall in all-cause mortality among children who are of suitable age to receive the vaccine). WHO issued prequalification approval for the RTS,S /AS01 vaccine and is the scientific lead and coordinator of the malaria vaccine implementation programme; an estimated one life is saved for every 200 children so vaccinated. The Contingency Fund for Emergencies released funding, in as little as 24 hours, to 70 graded emergencies in 2022, in line with WHO’s Emergency Response Framework. The Secretariat conducted 65 rapid risk assessment for 53 events in 30 countries, as well as 14 assessments for multicounty events. A highlight was the completion and circulation of 21 rapid risk assessment reports within a single week. Risk at the national level was assessed as very high or high for 90% of those events, which were mainly caused by cholera, measles, monkeypox/mpox, COVID-19, dengue, Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever and undiagnosed diseases. In total US$ 87.77 million were released to fund the initial response to acute events and scale up life-saving health operations in protracted crises in response to escalating needs. A fund dedicated to pandemic preparedness and prevention, the Pandemic Fund, was created with the financing needs and gap validated by G20 finance and health ministers. WHO hosted the secretariat of the G20 Joint Finance and Health Task Force, and contributed expertise on financing pandemic preparedness and prevention. The Pandemic Fund has an initial budget of US$ 1.6 billion and the WHO-chaired technical advisory panel will make key inputs into the scope of work funded. The Task Force has been extended into a multiyear arrangement. Ground-breaking international targets were set in order to address the use of antimicrobial agents across the animal, farming and human health sectors, and thereby tackle the devastating health and economic impacts of antimicrobial resistance – 1.3 million deaths were attributable to antimicrobial resistance in 2019. The Secretariat supported the development of targets for 2030 by advocating with governments and serving as secretariat for the Quadripartite, which includes the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Health Organization, World Organization for Animal Health and United Nations Environment Programme. More than 133 countries increased or introduced a new health tax between 2017 and 2022, showing that Member States are increasingly equipped to use fiscal measures to improve health, reduce health care costs and generate a revenue stream for development – owing in part to increased technical support and updated guidance from the Secretariat. Now 146 countries are protected by at least one measure of the MPOWER technical package; 60 countries are on track to achieving the global targets for reducing tobacco use; and health taxes are part of a comprehensive strategy for preventing noncommunicable diseases, which kill 41 million people every year. The mRNA hub in South Africa was established to build vaccine production capacity and enhance outbreak response in low- or middle-income countries. In 2022, the hub’s manufacturing process was developed, and mRNA technology started to be transferred from the hub to 15 spokes across all WHO regions. A training hub in the Republic of Korea was set up and has trained 300 staff in low- or middle-income countries on biomanufacturing and undertaking research on alternative uses for medical countermeasures. The model is being explored for applications to other medical technology needs. More than 50 countries transitioned crucial infrastructure from reliance on resources from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, integrating their polio assets, tools and knowledge to sustain critical functions related to immunization, disease surveillance and emergency response. The 37 countries that have completed the transition in the African Region remain polio-free. Polio networks, which in the Eastern Mediterranean Region have been repurposed to reach high-risk and hard-to reach populations with a broader package of health services, have responded to public health emergencies, such as outbreaks of cholera. In the South-East Asia Region, the integrated surveillance and immunization networks in the five priority countries were geared towards reversing the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on essential immunization, as the region hosts around 35% of the world’s “zero-dose children”. WHO’s funding commitment of US$ 33.2 million from the Core Voluntary Contributions Account has been catalytic to sustaining the essential polio functions through integration and ensuring their long-term sustainability. WHO reported an estimated 14.9 million excess deaths globally in 2020–2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic – reversing years of improvement in population health in many countries around the world. The effort to assess the true toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health at country, regional and global levels was joined by other United Nations entities and leading scientists worldwide, who consulted extensively with Member States using an effective online country portal supported by the World Health Data Hub. An update on both the magnitude and age/sex distribution of the excess mortality is ongoing and is expected to bring more clarity to the impacts of the pandemic on the triple billion targets and the health-related targets of the Sustainable Development Goals. The 2022 rounded estimates indicate a reduction in the global health workforce shortage to 15 million in 2020 and a projected global shortage of 10 million in 2030 based on current trends (mostly depicting a pre-COVID-19 situation). This is a significant decrease as compared with the earlier projection of a shortage of 18 million by 2030. However, the African and Eastern Mediterranean regions show less progress, will bear an increasing share of the total shortage in 2030 and may need to review their health labour market policies and investments.In addition to these highlights, many other important accomplishments are included in the full results report under the 12 outcomes and 42 outputs as we work towards universal health coverage, healthier populations, protection from health emergencies and a stronger WHO. Programme budget financing and implementation In May 2022, the Seventy-fifth World Health Assembly adopted resolution WHA75.5 on revision of the Programme budget 2022‒2023, in which it further approved the increase in the base budget segment of the Programme budget 2022–2023, as approved in resolution WHA74.3 (2021). Through resolution WHA75.5, the total Programme budget now stands at US$ 6726.1 million for the financial period 2022–2023. At the end of the first year of the biennium the total Programme budget had a good level of financing, including projections (US$ 8.3 billion), which surpassed the total approved budget (see Table 1). The good level of financing is explained by two event-driven budget segments: emergency operations and appeals, and polio eradication, the financing for which has needed to exceed the amounts established in the Programme budget in order to keep step with operational needs. Base programmes, representing the core work of the Organization, also had good financing levels for this time in the biennium: 87% when projected voluntary contributions were included. Despite these positive figures, as at 31 December 2022, the base programmes had a funding gap of US$ 660 million, after including projections of voluntary contributions. The current gap is compounded by the challenge of persisting pockets of poverty – underscoring the urgent need for more sustainable financing.Table 1.

The Secretariat greatly appreciates this commitment to WHO and notes the importance of maintaining and increasing the flexibility and predictability of the funds allocated to the Organization, and to strengthening the financing of the Organization’s core work as approved in WHO’s base programmes. At 38% (Table 1), levels of utilization of the budget for base programmes were lower than expected (50%) at the end of the first year of the biennium and appeared to be strongly linked with financing levels and time of arrival of funds. Utilization rates were on target when compared against available funding. In the current situation, when a large majority of the base budget segment is financed from specified voluntary contributions, the utilization challenge remains in chronically underfunded areas even if otherwise they have capacity to implement the budget. The Secretariat relies on the support of its Member States and other stakeholders to fill the remaining gap with increased efforts to mobilize more timely and flexible funding, which would also help to overcome persisting pockets of poverty and ensure a high rate of implementation of the Programme budget by the end of the biennium. For more details on the financing and implementation of the Programme budget 2022-2023, see the budget section of the results report. Challenges and looking forwardSustainable financing remains the major obstacle for the Secretariat to implement the priorities set by the Member States. As described above, pockets of poverty continue to exist both thematically and in major offices. These financing gaps imply that the envisaged and required work cannot be fully delivered. Despite much having been done in the past years to improve this situation, from through mobilizing more flexible resources to improving internal resource allocation mechanisms, these efforts can only marginally meet the long-standing financing challenges. It is welcome that Member States have the opportunity to put WHO on a more sustainable financing path at its 75th anniversary: the draft Proposed programme budget 2024–2025 has been developed with the expectation of a 20% increase in assessed contributions, marking a historic move towards a more empowered and independent WHO. A renewed commitment to health equity will be the key to overcoming future health challenges. In the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic, WHO’s road map to recovery includes an urgent paradigm shift towards promoting health and well-being and preventing disease by tackling its root causes and creating the conditions for health to thrive. Countries are being urged to provide health by prioritizing primary health care as the foundation of universal health coverage. This is the essence of the five priorities through which the Proposed programme budget 2024-2025 is: promoting health - to support countries to make a radical shift towards promoting health and well-being and preventing disease by addressing its root causes;providing health - to support a reorientation of health systems towards primary health care as the foundation of universal health coverage;protect health - to strengthen the capacities, systems and tools for health emergency preparedness, response and resilience at all levels, underpinned by strong governance and financing and coordinated globally by WHO;power health - to harness the power of science, research innovation, data and digital technologies as critical enablers of the other priorities; and perform for health - to empower WHO as the directing and coordinating authority on global health, at the centre of the global health architecture. Moving beyond GPW 13 and in light of the reversal of progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, WHO will have to redefine its strategy leading up to 2030. Working closely with Member States, the Secretariat will begin preparations for the draft Fourteenth General Programme of Work – building on lessons learnt from the GPW 13 and realigning our focus to accelerate progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.

To help you get totally prepared for the year ahead, we've gathered some of the major ones going into effect in 2023. Published: January 2023 In the last few years, new initiatives addressing corporate sustainability reporting have been on the upswing across jurisdictions in many regions. From sweeping policies that target global warming down to local legislations tackling human rights issues – a lot has already happened. And even more will happen in the years to come.However, making sense of the tangle of laws and regulations is no easy task. To help you keep it all straight in 2023, we'll cover some of the most important ones here.Without further due, let’s dig in. The EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) enters its level 2 phase and becomes mandatory Organizations affected: Investors and other financial market participants (FMPs)Important dates to know: January 1st, 2023 (the day it becomes mandatory)What is it?The EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) came into force in March 2021, but it didn’t become mandatory until January 1st, 2023 when it finally entered the level 2 phase. From this point on, in-scope FMPs will be obliged to comply with the set disclosure requirements, including: Collecting relevant data from portfolio companies and other entities Implementing the reporting templates (also known as Principle Adverse Impact indicators) Align your reporting process with the content and methodologies laid out by the regulation How Worldfavor can help:Kick-start your SFDR reporting process with our Sustainable Investments solution! It allows you to collect, aggregate, and analyze all relevant data from your portfolio companies in order to comply and report on time.​​With ready-to-use SFDR questionnaires, built-in equations that calculate the results for you, and a dedicated place to do your bespoke data sets (for articles 8 and 9 funds), the platform basically does the work for you. Sounds interesting? Learn more about it here! The EU Taxonomy: Taxonomy-alignment disclosure becomes mandatory for large companies Organizations affected: Large companies and FMPs offering products and services within the EU)Important dates to know: January 1st, 2023 (the day it becomes mandatory to report on the EU Taxonomy alignment)What is it?While the EU Taxonomy has been around for a while now (since 2020 to be exact), large companies haven’t been obliged to report on their Taxonomy alignment until January 1st, 2023. This means that from now on, organizations must publicly disclose to which degree (percentages) their turnover is taxonomy-aligned, i.e. fulfills the EU Taxonomy criteria on what is considered a “green” or “sustainable” economic activity. The six Taxonomy environmental objectives. On top of that, from 2023, it will be mandatory to disclose each economic activity’s alignment with the Taxonomy’s six environmental objectives. Before, it was only required to disclose the alignment for the first two: climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation – but now companies will have to answer for all six.

Download our EU Taxonomy guide here (which includes a test to see if you’re affected), or book a demo and see how we can help you implement your Taxonomy reporting in Worldfavor today. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD): enters into force on January 5th, 2023 Organizations affected: All listed companies on EU-regulated markets (without listed micro-enterprises)Important dates to know: January 5th, 2023 (the day the CSRD came into force); June 30th, 2023 (the day the directive’s mandatory sustainability reporting standards will be finalized)What is it?The most extensive sustainability reporting directive ever presented by the EU enteres into effect in January 2025, covering the fiscal year 2024. The directive’s first set of mandatory sustainability reporting standards will also be finalized this year – by the 30th of June, 2023 at the latest.Because the CSRD will cover all listed companies in EU-regulated markets (except listed micro-enterprises), it's not a bad idea to start getting familiar with it.

International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to finalize their standards in Q1 2023 Organizations affected: Investors and portfolio companiesImportant dates to know: Q1 2023, January-March (during which the standards will be finalized)What is it?You’ve probably already heard some buzz about these in 2022: the ISSB Sustainability Reporting Standards (ISSB). The ISSB standards are a set of upcoming sustainability reporting standards proposed by the International Sustainability Standards Board, developed to meet the urgent need for a comprehensive global baseline of corporate sustainability reporting. Many experts in the industry are saying that these standards are the solution to the current “alphabet soup” of the sustainability reporting landscape, finally standardizing it for good. The ISSB's first two standards, one on climate and one on general sustainability-related disclosures, are set to be finalized in Q1 of 2023 (as early as possible). After that, investors and other stakeholders demanding comparable and transparent ESG data are expected to start requiring companies to provide information according to the standards. How Worldfavor can help:For businesses and investors who want to keep up with the pace of progress – you don’t need to wait for the standards to be finalized to begin working with your data. You can already collect, manage, and report all of your sustainability information easily in Worldfavor. Let us show you how! The German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (the LkSG) enters into force Organizations affected: German and non-German companies with more than 3,000 employees are covered by the Act. The scope will broaden to companies with 1,000 employees starting in 2024.Important dates to know: January 1st, 2023 (the day the Act goes into effect)What is it?Don't get tricked into thinking the newly-adopted Supply Chain Due Diligence Act only applies to German companies. While the Act (also known as Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, or LkSG) was adopted by the German government, it also aims to uncover human rights violations in international supply chains, obligating all companies selling goods or products in the German market to set up a due diligence process. Companies that fail to comply or submit the required documentation risk facing fines and sanctions; for example, fines up to 2% of their annual turnover for largercompanies, exclusion from public contracts for up to three years, and damage to reputation and trust.How Worldfavor can help:Collect your data and set up your supply chain risk assessment in Worldfavor to get LkSG-compliant in no time.

This blog covers the latest updates, potential delays, supporting tools, and the consequences of non-compliance. Published: October 2024 As the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) deadline approaches many are asking: Will it be delayed? With concerns raised by major exporters like Brazil and Indonesia, and the complexity of compliance requirements, businesses are uncertain about what comes next. A delay could offer companies more time to adjust, but it may also hinder progress in curbing global deforestation. So, what’s the latest? Psst.. for a detailed breakdown of the EUDR, visit our blog: The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR): what you need to know Why is the EUDR important?Deforestation is a leading cause of climate change and biodiversity loss, and the EU contributes to this by consuming products linked to deforestation. The EUDR aims to make sure that the EU: Minimizes its global contribution to deforestation and forest degradation, helping to curb worldwide deforestation. Reduces its role in greenhouse gas emissions and supports efforts to protect global biodiversity. For more information, check out our blog: The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR): what you need to know Will EUDR be delayed? Lately, there have been rumors and calls for the EU to delay the implementation of the EUDR based on concerns that the regulation is too complex and that EU:s supporting tools such as the country benchmarking database and its depository for due diligence statements are delayed. Operators and traders have raised concerns that the regulation may lead to unfair competition for small-scale farmers and certain countries. Despite objections from major agricultural exporters like Brazil, India, Indonesia, and the US, the European Union reportedly stated it will not postpone the EUDR's implementation, which is set for December 30. This was announced during the World Trade Organization's (WTO) agriculture committee meeting on September 25 and 26. In a press release on October 2, EU Commission announced that it has requested a 12-month delay. And explains that this extended timeline will allow for the development of additional guidance documents and more time for preparation by global partners and both EU-member states and third countries. If approved by the European Parliament and the Council, the law would take effect on December 30, 2025, for large companies and June 30, 2026, for micro and small enterprises. With all the implementation tools technically ready, the additional 12 months can serve as a valuable phasing-in period to make sure a smooth and effective rollout. Update! On October 16, 2024, the Council agreed to extend the implementation by one year and will now inform the European Parliament of its position, paving the way for the Parliament to make a decision. The goal is to have the regulation formally adopted by both co-legislators and published in the Official Journal of the EU, allowing it to enter into force by the end of the year. The date for the voting is yet to be determined. Key compliance deadlines (entered into force June 29, 2023) Large companies: Must comply by December 2024 Small companies: Have until June 2025 Key compliance deadlines (new proposal announced Oct 2, 2024) Large companies: Must comply by December 2025 Small companies: Have until June 2026 EUDR compliance requirements: Key obligations for operators and traders Operators and traders need to trace the geolocation of commodities, assess risks, and verify compliance with national laws. This includes products like beef, soybeans, palm oil, coffee, and wood. Below is a table detailing obligations based on company size and type. Will the EU Due Diligence database be ready in time? In the press release shared on October 2nd, 2024, EU commission included an update of the tools for implementing the EUDR, the deforestation benchmarking database and the Due Diligence Registry. The Commission is engaging in dialogues with key stakeholders in affected countries to spearhead the finalization of the country benchmarking system, with a proposed Implementing Act set for June 30, 2025. Additionally, the Information System designed for businesses to register their due diligence statements will begin accepting registrations in early November 2024, with full functionality expected by December 2024. This allows operators and traders to register and submit their due diligence statements ahead of the law's enforcement, making sure they are well-prepared for compliance. What are the consequences of non-compliance with EUDR? Non-compliance with the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) can result in serious penalties for operators and traders, including both financial and operational sanctions. Here’s what could happen if a company fails to meet the regulation’s requirements: Fines: Companies may face fines amounting to at least 4% of their total annual EU-wide turnover. Confiscation of products: The relevant products that do not comply with the EUDR can be confiscated by authorities. Confiscation of revenues: Any revenues earned from transactions involving non-compliant products may also be seized. Exclusion from public contracts: Companies could be temporarily excluded (up to 12 months) from public procurement processes, including access to public funding, grants, and tenders. Market restrictions: A temporary prohibition may be placed on a company, preventing it from placing or exporting the relevant commodities or products on the market. Restriction on simplified due diligence: Companies that commit serious or repeated violations may lose the ability to use simplified due diligence procedures, as outlined in Article 13 of the EUDR (Source: Article 25 of the EUDR.) Non-compliance can seriously impact both the financial and operational standing of a company, making it essential to follow the regulation closely. How to implement EUDR – the common denominator The EUDR may seem complex with its many new requirements for companies, but it’s important to remember its core purpose: to reduce global deforestation by targeting high-risk commodities that contribute significantly to this issue. This regulation also aims to lower EU trade-related greenhouse gas emissions and promote long-term sustainable production, benefiting both people and the planet. In practical terms, one common denominator applies to all companies: Know your supply chain. Understand which suppliers are concerned and where the commodities were grown and produced! While the commodities under the EUDR differ in features and supply chain complexity, this foundational step is essential for compliance and sustainability. Worldfavor's digital tool can help you identify and track your EUDR commodities and derived products. Talk to a Worldfavor expert today to learn how!

Need help navigating your sustainability reporting? Then don't miss our Sustainability reporting playbook: By establishing a set of goals, measuring performance, and managing change, you can make your operations more sustainable. The first step is to choose which reporting framework to follow. The main aim of sustainability reporting frameworks is to turn theoretical issues into concrete actions. Sustainability reporting will help your organization set priorities to reach environmental and social impact goals by exposing both positive or negative impacts on the planet, society and the economy. The UN Sustainable Development Goals should probably be familiar to you by now, so here, we look at some other common sustainability reporting frameworks you may wish to look at more closely: Global reporting initiative (GRI) GRI is an independent international organization that has pioneered sustainability reporting since 1997. The GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) are a reporting framework for organizations to disclose both positive and negative impacts on the environment, society and the economy. GRI Standards are designed to be universally applicable to all organizations of all types and sectors, large and small, across the world. Find out more about GRI standards here. International organization for standardization (ISO) ISO is an independent, non-governmental international organization with a membership of 164 national standards bodies. One of its more important standards is ISO 14001, the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system. It provides a framework that an organization can follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements. Find out more about ISO here. Tips! Want to know more about how can work with ISO Standards in Worldfavor? Read about our Sustainability Management solution. Principles for responsible investments (PRI) Supported by the United Nations, the PRI is the world’s leading proponent of responsible investment. It works to understand the investment implications of ESG factors and to support its international network of investor signatories in incorporating these factors into their investment and ownership decisions. The PRI actively encourages investors to use responsible investment to enhance returns and better manage risks, but does not operate for its own profit. Find out more about the PRI here. Sustainability accounting standards board (SASB) Founded in 2011, SASB focuses specifically on developing standards for sustainability information aimed at investors: data that could affect their financial decisions about a company. It basically connects businesses and investors on the financial impacts of sustainability. Together with GRI, SASB is one of the most important frameworks for sustainability reporting. Find out more about SASB here. In the end of 2020 SASB and GRI announced a collaboration, aiming to create better transparency and trust among reporting companies. United Nations Global Compact UN Global Compact is a voluntary initiative for companies that are willing to set in motion changes to business operations so that the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles become part of strategy, culture and day-to-day operations. Since July 2000, UN Global Compact has received more than 62,000 public reports by over 9,000 companies in 159 countries. Find out more about UN Global Compact here.

Now companies and financial firms need to ensure their sustainability reporting frameworks are in line with government regulations. Some regulations are already in place, but most have yet to be fully implemented and enforced. A few are even still in development and haven’t been officially released. Currently, the European Union is really the only one with requirements for ESG disclosures to investors and the public. But other governments will likely model their reporting regulations on the EU’s, since many, like the United States, are expected to follow suit over the next few years — some of which are already in place and some are on the way. So here are 5 current and future regulations that will likely require updating your reporting framework or switching to new climate frameworks in the near future, along with key dates to watch out for. 1. EU’s sustainable finance disclosure regulation (SFDR) Passed in the spring of 2019, Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) is a cornerstone in the regulation of sustainable finance. It aims to prevent greenwashing by creating transparency around sustainability within the financial market. It requires Financial Market Participants (FMPs) operating within the EU — both on a firm and product level — to disclose information on their sustainability practices and sustainability indicators. Presenting such information will force a full review of any firm’s business and undoubtedly lead to new policy decisions, applying to all FMPs, not just those offering financial products with a sustainability or ESG focus. SFDR key dates: March 10th, 2021: When most of the SFDR’s substantive framework requirements and general principles must begin being applied. It’s the earliest date to begin the first reference period for reporting. June 30, 2021: The final date that FMPs with more than 500 employees must start considering principal adverse impacts and collecting relevant data for the first reference period. January 1st, 2022: The first day of the second reference period and when periodic reporting obligations begin to apply. December 30th, 2022: When additional periodic reporting obligations begin to apply. June 30, 2022: The last date that FMPs can report for the first time their performance on various ESG indicators, including “details of the assessment of principal adverse sustainability impacts” from the first reference period. If you would like to get to know more about how to get ready for the SFDR with Worldfavor, download our guide here. 2. EU’s amendment to non-financial reporting directive (NFRD) One of the major challenges caused by SFDR has been that many FMPs, like investment fund managers, find themselves required to make disclosures before the companies they invest in are legally obligated to provide detailed sustainability information. What information companies are supposed to disclose that isn’t financial is regulated by the EU’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). It currently has no provisions related to sustainability or ESG. But an initiative for an amendment, which is legislative change to the NFRD, is in the works. The update will legally require large companies (those with more than 500 employees) to “disclose non-financial information on their social and environmental impact”. When it is added, the new requirements will likely create a rippling of updates in reporting frameworks, through supply chains and up investment ladders. NFDR key dates: April 21st, 2021: When the EU’s Financial Services Commissioner is reported to announce its plans for adding ESG requirements to NFRD. 3. EU Taxonomy regulation The EU Taxonomy is a regulatory classification system, which defines whether certain economic activities are environmentally sustainable. It provides FMPs and large company’s a toolkit for assessing their sustainability, as well as how to promote and market themselves as such, and is thus a big part of many sustainability reporting frameworks. The EU Taxonomy lists six key objectives for performance thresholds: Climate change mitigation; Climate change adaptation; Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; Transition to a circular economy; Pollution prevention and control; Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. EU Taxonomy key dates: January 1st, 2022: Financial institutions and large companies must start reporting on Taxonomy-eligibility for the two climate objectives. January 1st, 2023: Large companies must report on Taxonomy Alignment. 2023: Technical screening criteria for the remaining four environmental objectives start to apply. January 1st, 2024: Financial institutions and large companies must report on Taxonomy alignment. 2024: Full EU Taxonomy disclosure on all six environmental objectives. Download the Worldfavor EU Taxonomy guide to find out if the regulation applies to your organization. 4. EU’s Draft Delegated Acts for investment managers and firms One major upcoming piece of the European Commission’s Sustainable Finance Action Plan is a group of draft measures to update regulations for specific kinds of investment firms to include reporting frameworks for public and investor-facing ESG disclosures. The types of firms and managers affected are: Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) Firms Draft Delegated Acts key dates: Q3 or Q4 2021: Although the acts are still in draft form, they are expected to come into effect sometime in the last half of 2021. 5. EU Ecolabel for financial products First established in 1992, the EU Ecolabel is a mark of environmental excellence that is given only to products and services that meet strict standards of sustainability and specifically contribute to a circular economy. There are EU EcolabeIs for everything from cleaning products and electronic equipment to hotels and campsites; each category with its own rigorous criteria to earn the label. And an EU Ecolabel for financial products, with its own reporting framework and minimum requirements, is currently in the works. The EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) published its first preliminary report on EU Ecolabel criteria for financial products in March of 2019 and is expected to deliver its final recommendations for the criteria in 2021. EU Ecolabel financial products key dates: Q4 2021: While still an ongoing project at JCR, the final criteria for financial products to receive the EU Ecolabel is expected to be adopted by the European Commission in the last quarter of 2021. Keeping up with lawmakers to save the climate We’re seeing constant changes in laws and regulations as a response to the climate crisis. That means there will not only be more requirements on what needs to be reported from more government bodies, national and local, but also changes and updates to the ones that already exist. For companies it means keeping up with new requirements and maybe stepping up their sustainability game with higher transparency and a sustainability management process.

An important step in this process is to provide a sustainability report, which not only has several benefits for you as a retailer – it will also help you communicate your sustainability efforts directly to stakeholders. Find out why you need a sustainability report, what it should include, and our best tips on how to present the results. Published: March 2023In the wake of the climate crisis, consumers are becoming more aware of the impact their choices have on our environment, and there is stronger shift towards a sustainable and circular economy. People are more familiar than ever with issues like greenwashing and human rights violations, and the demands on businesses to provide transparency is growing – whether that’s through legislation or companies being held accountable by the communities in which they operate. Transparency is crucial for businesses to effectively implement corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and should be a cornerstone within your business operations. Companies can no longer claim they’re sustainable – today they have to prove it. Want more content like this in your inbox? Get weekly updates on the latest sustainability trends, regulations, and other awesome insights. Why do you need a sustainability report? Providing a sustainability report comes with several benefits. It will enhance your company's transparency, resulting in increased credibility and accountability. This, in turn, can make your business more appealing to potential customers and investors. Moreover, creating a sustainability report can help attract talent as employees have become more interested in working for environmentally and socially responsible organizations. A sustainability report is an excellent way to communicate your company's sustainability initiatives to a wide variety of stakeholders, keep track of your progress, and identify risks and opportunities within your company. It's also a tool to encourage more sustainable practices among your stakeholders and community. The goal of your report is to identify the priorities of your company and report on the work being made to achieve them. In order to avoid claims of greenwashing and mitigate potential risk, it’s important to be transparent in the report. A sustainability report should include three elements: Environmental report: includes information about your environmental effect, e.g. carbon footprint and water usage. Social report: shows your company’s contribution to society through your practices and policies. Include information on community outreach programs supported by the company, potential benefits derived from corporate social responsibility projects, and highlights of your corporate giving activities. Financial report: informs on your performance and investments. What is ESG? Sustainable investing evaluates companies based on their performance in three areas: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG). By using these metrics, investors can determine how sustainable and resilient a company is, and hold it accountable for its sustainability claims. ESG helps companies set measurable goals, gain insights into risks and opportunities, avoid greenwashing, and meet regulations and demands. ESG regulations differ across countries and industries, compliance with regional differences is crucial, as non-compliance can result in severe consequences, including fines, reputation damage, and revenue loss. What supplier information to include in your report When it comes to choosing supplier information for your report, it’s important to provide your code of conduct, which ensures that your suppliers adhere to your company’s standards in the supply chain. A code of conduct should include: Labor practice and standards: The standards and requirements that your suppliers are committed to following, such as compliance with fair working conditions, that may include child labor laws and fair wages. Do you offer any program to help the workers improve their situation? If so include that in the report and explain how it benefits Environmental policy: This includes the material used in production and distribution, with a focus on sustainable materials, list of restricted substances that your suppliers are committed to following, as well as information on water usage. Ethics: The purpose of these components is to implement measures against corruption, while also upholding ethical business practices and effectively managing relationships with partners. Review and documentation policy: How you ensure that your suppliers are following your code of conduct, including what steps you take to address social risks (such as poor working conditions) in your supply chain. In terms of supplier information, it's also important to present: Data on the number of suppliers monitored: This may include the year when you started working with the supplier, the amount of suppliers participating in programs, complaints received, and suppliers participating in programs. Location: List where your suppliers are located. If some part of your production takes place in a high-risk country or countries, this should be disclosed in your report. Metrics on supplier performance: A good framework to use is to use the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which include goals such as clean water and sanitation, responsible consumption and production, and decent work and economic growth. Don’t forget! Disclose your risk assessment, including areas that need improvement in your supply chain, and your company's goals regarding your supply chain, such as striving for full transparency. It’s also important to present the results of your sustainability efforts in order to show your progress. By including this information, your sustainability report will be more comprehensive and transparent, allowing stakeholders to make more informed decisions about your company's sustainability practices. How to present your results When presenting your results in the sustainability report, it’s important to have clear communication so that all stakeholders can understand the information. For large amounts of data, the best way is to use tables and graphs, which makes the information easy to digest and comprehend for the reader. You can also provide details on how to read the report and what each category includes, and explain the words you use by providing a glossary of editorial terms. Another tip is to include stakeholder reports in the form of a document for each stakeholder, making it easier for them to find relevant information. Example of supplier information in Nudie Jeans and O'Neills sustainability reports For efficient distribution and ease of access to your sustainability report, you should publish it online. You may also print copies for distribution to select stakeholders. Simplify your reporting process Reporting your ESG data can be both complex and confusing. Worldfavor's standard reports reduce your reporting burden and enable you to share your data in a smarter way, based on the latest reporting standards, frameworks, initiatives, and regulations in your industry. You'll save time and create consistency – plus, provide a common language for suppliers and business partners to communicate and report in a standardized and systemized format.

The global goals will only be reached when small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are fully onboard. Here we look at why SMEs should be reporting, where to start, and how the SDGs can create value for SMEs as well as their stakeholders. Why reporting is essential The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a vital framework for addressing the world’s most urgent challenges, and the private sector will play a necessary role in any solution. It represents a significant source of jobs across all economic sectors and geographical areas via both large corporate organizations and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Defined as any business with fewer than 250 employees, SMEs provide regular income and access to public services to millions of people living in both developed and emerging economies. A 2015 World Bank brief reported that formal SMEs contribute up to 60% of total employment and up to 40% of GDP in emerging economies. “SMEs account for an overwhelming majority of private sector business and economic activity in both developed and developing countries,” writes Carlyann Edwards. “This means they are well-positioned to have a significant impact on reaching the global goals,” she adds. The size of SMEs makes it much easier to implement new principles than at large corporates. This is because the are more agile and able to quickly adopt new ways of doing things and measure impact. Where to start Small steps are the way forward when it comes to reporting on the SDGs. “A first step for a small business may be as simple as looking at the 17 goals and identifying the top two or three that really resonate and can be used to engage staff and other stakeholders in discussions, to create buy-in from the beginning,” according to Carolina Karlstrom. KPMG’s 2018 report, How to report on the SDGs: What looks good and why it matters, features several useful tips on SDG reporting, which readers can use as a guide for their own reporting. It analyzes how the world's 250 largest companies measure up to help readers benchmark their efforts. The authors established a set of nine criteria to consider when reporting on the SDGs, grouped into three broader categories: Understanding: This covers why internal support and alignment over why reporting is not only needed but also supports strategic business aims. Prioritisation: Here, companies are encouraged to focus their action on the goals on which they can have the most actual and potential impact. Measurement: Measuring and managing contribution to the realization of the SDGs. Elsewhere, the SDG Accelerator is a UNDP programme funded by the Danish Industry Foundation aiming to accelerate business solutions with the SDGs. 30 Danish SMEs are currently onboard and the plan is to roll out the initiative first across the Nordics and then globally: “Participating companies will receive guidance and a comprehensive method to develop new products, services or business models that address the challenges embedded in the SDGs. In addition, companies will be assisted in communicating and engaging their employees in their work with the SDGs through internal campaigns and activities.” Another useful resource is The SDG Compass, which provides guidance for companies on how they can align their strategies as well as measure and manage their contribution to the realization of the SDGs. Choosing the right platform for your reporting is an important step. Pick the one that enables you to report any sustainability and compliance information about your company that your customers or other partners request. Tips! Curious about sustainability reporting in Worldfavor? Download the guide How reporting can create value for you can your stakeholders The SDGs can be catalysts for creating shared value through innovation, growth and better competitive performance but reporting requires company-wide buy-in. One way to achieve this is through efficient reporting and communication. Many businesses will already report on and communicate on topics covered by the SDGs, such as climate change or diversity and empowerment in the workplace. Aligning your reporting and communication in the context of the expectations and language of the SDGs will give your stakeholders valuable tools to align with and share progress in a widely understandable way. Stakeholders can also provide relevant information and inspiration for exploring business opportunities related to the SDGs. Whatever the size of the business, we all have an important contribution to make to the aims of the Sustainable Development Goals: “Foster peace and prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future”. By reporting on the SDGs, you’ll be able to not only measure the contribution your business is making, accelerate growth and better competitive performance, but also set your own targets and share information with suppliers, clients and regulatory authorities.

Even those based in countries or regions that don’t require sustainability reporting or management are feeling the pressure — from investors, international partners, and customers — to not only disclose that information but do so accurately and with precision. What’s more, putting a sustainability reporting system in place before government regulations are imposed can be a serious advantage over the competition. But like any other complex endeavor that spans across an entire organization, how a company starts reporting is just as critical as how the sustainability reporting process operates after it’s established. Setting a proper foundation can prevent a lot of headaches and course-correcting. Here are some essential things companies need to do when they’re getting started with sustainability reporting: Decide on what sustainability metrics and data to collect This may seem like a simple decision, but it’s more complicated than most realize. While metrics and data come in number-based measurements that are universal — a kilowatt of electricity is the same no matter where or how it’s used — the classification and importance of those measurements often depend on a framework that uses additional data that also needs to be reported — like if that kilowatt of electricity comes from a solar farm or coal-burning power plant. What framework, and thus the full extent of metrics and data, that a company collects for its sustainability reporting can hinge on a lot of different factors, like the regulations of its region and industry, any sustainability reporting frameworks used by others in its value chain, and its organizational goals and philosophy. It’s not uncommon for companies to collect data under more than one framework. The denim brand Nudie Jeans has made sustainability a core part of its business and so collects a wide variety of data and metrics. According to the Nudie Jeans website, the company uses several different sustainability management frameworks and reporting frameworks. It uses the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) to track emissions and set goals to help fight climate change. At the same time, it applies a framework by the Fair Wear Foundation (a non-profit focused on fair labor within the garment industry) to monitor data tied to social sustainability. But that’s not all. Nudie Jean’s annual sustainability report uses the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework, the Fair Wear Foundation’s yearly Brand Performance Check, and the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Invest in sustainability reporting software It’s no coincidence that the rise of sustainability management and reporting as a significant facet of business operations matches the availability of tech solutions for tracking sustainability metrics and data. Yet, many companies still don’t use software or platforms designed for sustainability reporting, relying on spreadsheets or something similar. For the most part, software makes the sustainability reporting process a lot easier. Once it’s installed and calibrated, data is automatically collected and organized. Compared to manual reporting methods, it’s a much less labor-intensive job. Using a digital solution is also more conducive for gaining insight. Most sustainability management/reporting software feature toolsets that showcase the information in ways that can shed light and inspire action. Plus, all the time otherwise spent handling and sorting the data can be used for analysis. So any initial costs, whether it’s time or money, for sustainability reporting software should be seen as an investment. Since sustainability is central to its business model, plant-based food brand Oatly needed to upgrade and invest in software for its sustainability reporting when its international presence snowballed. Initially, Oatly’s sustainability team used a task-heavy system to collect data, with spreadsheets and sent templates to be filled out at its offices and production facilities around the world. Oatly’s switch to a web-based platform to collect data not only allowed it to streamline the process internally but also integrate data collection from more than a dozen external partners. The company’s sustainability reporting now encompasses data input by over 100 people from approximately 30 sites but stored and analyzed in one place. Organize stakeholder engagement strategies throughout the entire reporting process Like sustainability, the concept of stakeholder engagement has become increasingly popular in the world of business leadership. And with good reason, identifying and interacting with those who affect and are affected by a company’s actions can be critical in its success. What’s interesting is that there’s evidence stakeholder engagement can also be crucial to sustainability reporting. According to a 2020 study of stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting, which looked at over 100 different companies in the energy sector based in 40 other countries, there are different levels of stakeholders and engagement intensity. What’s more, the companies studied seemed to “concentrate their engagement actions at the least complex levels” and missed out on opportunities for more complex and strategic engagement. With massive holdings in agriculture, retail, and telecom, the Charoen Pokphand Group (CP Group) is the largest private company in Thailand and seems keen to find and thoroughly interact with others as it strives to become a carbon-neutral and zero-waste company by 2030. According to the 2020 edition of the annual Reporting Matters publication by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), which analyzes sustainability reports from member companies and gives an overview of reporting trends with examples of best practices, the CP Group is a premiere model for stakeholder engagement in sustainability reporting. The company focuses on ten identified stakeholders and is also transparent in any challenges to engage with them. It even provides some stakeholders with the opportunity to comment on and critique its sustainability efforts, which the WBCSD notes enhances “a sense of balance in the report.” Ensure the correct sustainability data will be reported The need to report sustainability data that’s accurate goes without saying. That’s why it’s so critical to set up safeguards to verify the information being reported is correct and to have them in place before reporting starts. There are any number of reasons for bad data, and using a system of governance to review and check it can help spot errors before it’s too late. As a guide by the sustainable business consultant group BSR points out: “Reporting governance processes and systems will be unique for each company.” But BSR also notes that, atypical styles or not, a common benefit for setting up oversight procedures is buy-in from internal stakeholders across the organization. Appliance manufacturer Electrolux is one of the largest multinational corporations in the world, which means it requires a serious system of governance to ensure its reporting and management are accurate and effective. In the most recent annual sustainability report on Electrolux’s website, the company lists a dozen auditing and monitoring processes, including several different types of audits, employee surveys, certifications, external verification, and even a third-party operated ethics hotline. Launching a sustainability reporting program is a serious endeavor. Very few complex efforts or undertakings happen without an unexpected problem of one kind or another. But taking the time to put some essential aspects in place before any data is collected can go a long way in minimizing issues and establishing quick solutions beforehand. In the end, a company has to focus on being more sustainable, not fixing its sustainability reporting.

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are directly tied to the ‘Decade of Action’, which has become increasingly important as we ramp up towards the 2030 deadline over the next decade. Agenda 2030 has left the world with ten years to enact measurable change, but what does that mean for businesses that are going to be affected in numerous ways? Find out more about what the Decade of Action mean for the companies, governments and people who are expected to change their modus operandi, and what has been achieved so far. What is the ‘Decade of Action’? As the UN explains, the Decade of Action ‘calls for accelerating sustainable solutions to all the world’s biggest challenges – ranging from poverty and gender to climate change, inequality and closing the finance gap.’The Sustainable Development Goals were first adopted in 2015, emphasizing a holistic approach to achieving sustainable development for all. They aim to have an impact across multiple levels, as detailed below. The UN is using the SDGs as a measuring stick for change, and 2030 is the hard deadline for results. Nobody is exempt, as they have attempted to make the goals realistic in every region. It’s clear that COVID-19 has had an impact on achieving the SDGs, but that has not stopped a concentrated effort to meet them in time for 2030.The UN Secretary-General has identified three different levels in which changes can be made. ‘Global action’ is the first, aiming to lead in terms of policy and providing the resources to do so. ‘Local action’ will see policies enacted, by organizations such as governments and local authorities. Lastly, ‘people action’ is seen on the ground level, and focuses on the choices and decisions the public makes individually. What progress has been made so far? Progress has been achieved in terms of achieving the 17 SDGs, but the COVID-19 pandemic has had an undeniable impact in 2020. For example, reduced air travel is one benefit, but wealth inequality has been exacerbated by declining household incomes, as well as the rich getting richer. The 17 Goals have a further 169 targets. 35 of these targets are trackable thanks to sufficiently up-to-date numbers, leading to a global race to see what is being achieved worldwide. The UN released a video detailing progress from 2015 to 2020, including an infographic which shows how close we currently are to the targets: As you can see, as of September 2020, some of the targets are actually moving in the wrong direction. This means that the goals are less likely to be achieved by 2030, but it’s not the worst result overall when you consider that there is still just under a decade left to go. We used to view the environment, society, and the economy as separate entities, which seems slightly ridiculous in hindsight. Our collective mindset needs to change, and it does seem like the response from businesses has been positive so far. The switch has led to businesses having more of an active role in terms of understanding their impact on both the environment and society, as well as increased responsibilities that would have been unthinkable just 20 years ago. Since the launch of the SDGs in 2015, UN Global Compact participants are taking more action. For example, in the industrial manufacturing system, 83 percent of companies now work to support the SDGs, which is up from 60 percent in 2015. The same is true for many different industries, highlighting that businesses are taking the UN, and the SDGs, seriously. Tip! Getting started with the Sustainable Development Goals does not have to be time-consuming. Check out our 15-minute read beginners guide to the SDGs to learn more. What needs to be done over the next decade? Businesses will face a number of changes over the next ten years. COVID-19 may have helped or hindered progress depending on the sector, but that hasn’t stopped a sustained effort to make a real difference before the deadline comes to pass. No matter which way you look at it, systemic changes are needed to reach the Sustainable Development Goals by the target date. Businesses will need to be aligned with the SDGs, which is why Agenda 2030 is so important for measuring the impact of measures put in place. Targets that are lagging behind may benefit from SDG Acceleration Actions, which are initiatives voluntarily undertaken to accelerate SDG implementation by key stakeholder groups. They have already worked to implement 237 actions so far. The consequences of a failure to act will be catastrophic, and will only lead to stronger regulations as the world becomes more desperate to stop the impact of climate change, as well as other serious issues such as poverty. Global collaboration is the ideal way to move forward, and we can all make a change on some level. For businesses specifically, working to implement any suggestions or procedures offered by the SDGs is likely the best way to enact real measurable change by 2030.

Find out what you must disclose and when to ensure you comply with the SFDR obligations.Does the SFDR apply to you? Get your own Worldfavor SFDR guide: Updated: October 2022 On 1/1/23, the SFDR entered its Level 2 phase. The SFDR is an EU regulation that sets out environmental, social, and governance disclosure requirements for financial market participants active within the European Union. But what is SFDR Level 2? Once SFDR Level 2 is adopted, it will be mandatory for firms to implement the reporting templates (Principle Adverse Impact indicators), comply with the methodologies, and present the information under the SFDR disclosure requirements, while prior firms have had the opportunity to explain why they are not complying yet. This means that if you’re still unsure of precisely what you must disclose and when – it is high time to figure it out. Luckily, you don’t have to pull an all-nighter trying to make sense of it. In this blog, we listed what you have to disclose and when to make sure you’re SFDR compliant. Let’s have a look! SFDR’s key reporting dates. From 30 June 2021: PAI statement available for the public on your website [Level 1] 30 June 2021 marked one of the key dates for the beginning of the SFDR. From this day, the “comply or explain” obligation became mandatory for Financial market participants (FMPs) with more than 500 employees. Firms are obligated to publish and keep a statement on their website relating to their principal adverse impact (PAI) and due diligence policies and how they plan to take action on the negative social impact and ecological footprint of their investments. This statement is often referred to as a “PAI Statement”, as its purpose is to cover the PAIs of funds’ investments on ESG factors. When an FMP does not consider the adverse impacts of investment decisions on sustainability factors, it must publish and maintain on its website clear reasons for why it does not do so and, where relevant, information as to whether and when it intends to do so. What to Include in your PAI Statement? The PAI statement is intended to increase the transparency of investment decisions that negatively affect sustainability factors. Article 4 of SFDR describes sustainability factors as “climate and other environment-related impacts and adverse impacts in the field of social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters''. In addition, the statement must also include any already taken or planned action to combat these negative effects. PAI Statement checklist: Information about their policies on the identification and prioritization of principal adverse sustainability impacts and indicators A description of the PAIs and taken or planned actions to manage them Brief summaries of engagement policies with reference to internationally recognized standards for due diligence and reporting and where relevant – the degree of their alignment with the Paris Agreement objectives. 31 December 2022: The first reference period ends The FMPs are obliged to report on the PAIs latest on 30 June each year – with a reference period of the previous calendar year. The first reference period (running from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022) ends on 31 December 2022, meaning that in-scope firms must collect all relevant data according to the SFDR’s requirements for this period needed for their SFDR reporting on 30 June 2023. 1 January 2023: Participants are required to comply with SFDR Level 2 From 1 January 2023, the SFDR’s level 2 becomes applicable to in-scope firms and FMPs can no longer go for the 'explain’ option. SFDR level 2 provides detailed sustainability-related disclosure obligations, including mandatory reporting templates and methodology to which the firms must report accordingly. What are the SFDR PAI indicators? The mandatory reporting temple (set out in Annex 1) outlines a set of indicators for your PAI statement, focusing on climate and environment-related adverse impacts as well as adverse impacts on social and employee, respect for human rights, anti-corruption, and anti-bribery matters. These indicators are divided into a set of 14 core indicators and 31 additional indicators. Investors should report on all 14 core indicators + 2 additional (at least one climate and environmental-related + one social and employee-related) indicators. The disclosure requirements are not limited to the PAI indicators, but also require firms to set up policies on the identification of principal adverse impacts, actions taken and planned to mitigate the principal adverse impacts, adherence to international standards, and a historical comparison covering at least five previous reference periods. What are the mandatory PAI indicators? Climate and other environment-related indicators: GHG emissions (Scope 1,2, and 3, and total GHG emissions)Carbon GHG intensity of investee companies Share of investment in companies active in the fossil fuel sector Share on non-renewable energy consumption and production Energy consumption intensity per high-impact climate sector Activities negatively affecting biodiversity - sensitive areas Emissions to water Hazardous waste ration Social and employee, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters: Violations of UN Global Compact principles and Organizations for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guidelines for multinational enterprises Lack of processes and compliance mechanisms to monitor compliance with UN Global Compact Principles and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises Unadjusted general pay gap Board gender diversity Exposure to controversial weapons (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons and biological weapons) Are you looking for a smooth way to collect, manage and report PAI indicator data?

Let us tell you more! 1 January 2023: Second reference period starts With the Level 2 phase enacted, compiling with the SFDR disclosure requirements becomes mandatory. The second reference period stretches from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023. 30 June 2023: Reporting of the first reference period FMPs need to report their performance on the first reference period through the PAI statement and other disclosure requirements of the Level 2 SFDR no later than 30 June 2023. The PAI statement must be published on the firm’s webpage in a manner that is easily accessible, free of charge, not misleading, and easy to read. 30 June 2024 and onwards: Reporting of the next reference period FMPs are required to report no later than 30 June each year, meaning that the reporting of the second reference period must be done until 30 June 2024. From this report onwards, it also needs to include a year-to-year comparison between the reference periods. The comparison ought to cover at least five reference periods once you’ve reached the fifth reference period. For more detailed information, see the SFDR’s Final Report on draft Regulatory Technical Standards.

In this blog, we cover everything you need to know about the SFDR and how to comply. Does the SFDR apply to you? Get your own Worldfavor SFDR guide: 2 December 2022: This blog has been updated as a response to the European Commission's decision to push back the implementation of SFDR discourse requirements until 1 January 2023. Keep reading to find out all you need to know about the new update! What is SFDR? SFDR is the first regulation set by the EU which aims to reorientate capital flow towards sustainable finance. SFDR is inserted to provide transparency on sustainability within the financial market and thereby prevent greenwashing. Sustainable finance is already on the up-swing worldwide. As a part of the ongoing transition towards a low-carbon, more resource-efficient and sustainable economy, the European Commission have implemented various new and updated regulations to bolster its action plan on sustainability finance. While the EU Taxonomy may be regarded as the key component of the action plan, there are a handful of other regulations that are coming your way to get familiar with. One of those is the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation – also known as the SFDR for those of you who keep track of the acronyms. SFDR's main purpose is to reorientate capital towards more sustainable businesses and increase transparency on sustainability among financial institutions and market participants. The regulation was implemented on March 10th 2021, which means it's really time to learn more about what it is, who is affected and the most important actions needed to comply in time. And we are here to help! Download our guide and get ready for the SFDR with Worldfavor. What is the EU SFDR? The SFDR was adopted by the European Commission in the spring of 2019 as a proposal for \"a regulation on disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks”. The primary goal is to increase transparency on sustainability to ensure that financial market participants (FMP) are able to finance growth in a sustainable manner. It consists of disclosure requirements on both business and product-level to standardize sustainability disclosure while combat “greenwashing” (companies giving a false impression of their environmental impact or benefits). Source: Nordea Funds In practice, the implementation on March 10 means that FMPs in the EU are obligated to disclose information on their sustainability practices (firm-level) and their financial products (product-level). In addition, FMPs need to report on their Principal Adverse Impacts (PAI) on both a firm- and a product level. The PAIs consists of a list of both mandatory and voluntary sustainability indicators, such as GHG emissions, human rights and waste management - that have to be taken into consideration in the businesses' investment policies and decisions. The purpose is to ensure that firms take a similar approach in their sustainability disclosure. After all, sustainability is a joint movement. Download our guide Get ready for the SFDR with Worldfavor and learn how your company can align with the SFDR. Who is affected by the SFDR? The SFDR regulation applies to the financial market participants (FMPs) and are defined as the “big players”, such as investment firms, pension funds, asset managers, insurance companies, banks, venture capital funds, credit institutions offering portfolio management, or financial advisors. FMPs with less than 500 employees are not obligated to comply with the SFDR. However, as the comply-or-explain principle applies, they are obligated to explain why. Although SFDR is an EU regulation, funds outside of Europe that are marketed in Europe also fall under the disclosure requirements. Since the regulation will have such an extensive impact on sustainability worldwide, many consider it to be a point-of-no-return for the financial market: it is only getting greener from here. Save the date (new update!) In November 2021, the European Commission confirmed that they are postponing the application date for the SFDR’s regulatory technical standards (SFDR RTS) from 1 January 2022 to 1 January 2023. In the confirmation letter written by John Berrigan, European Commission Deputy Director-General for Financial Stability, he deferred the application due to the “length and technical detail” of the standards, requiring “additional time in the adoption process.” In other words, the decision to push back to 2023 was made to ensure a smoother implementation process for all in-scope FMPs. Despite this delay, the collection and monitoring of PAI will still be required from 1 January 2022 – when the first reference period for the SFDR begins. How to implement the EU SFDR So, how will it work in practice? Considering that the first SFDR requirements are approaching quickly – now is the time to act. We have listed the essential steps to get you started: Scope: Determine what parts of the SFDR applies to your organization and products and how to align accordingly. Get familiar with your sustainability actions and status: No matter how far you’ve come in your sustainability journey, performing gap analysis and risk assessments on up-to-date data, actions and policies will help you uncover blind spots and gaps. Set a personalized SFDR strategy: Determine what actions are needed to be taken by your business for complete compliance with the new regulation. Create an action plan for your sustainability risk policy, due diligence policy, remuneration policy and communication strategies. SFDR won’t be postponed forever. Get ready now! While the new date may feel far far away, forming an SFDR strategy requires a lot of time and resources. Make sure to take advantage of the extra time given and get started as soon as possible for a stress-free implementation process! To sum it all up – EU is quick-paced and leaves no time to waste to turn the financial sector over to a sustainable one. This means that the market leaders today may not necessarily be leading tomorrow. Sustainable business is the future and it's time for everyone to get aboard.

Views are welcome from financial market participants, investors, NGOs, relevant public authorities, national regulators, and others that are subject directly or indirectly to the provisions of the SFDR and/or have more in-depth knowledge and/or (working) experience in the field of sustainable finance disclosures. Objective of the consultation The SFDR has been in application since March 2021. In December 2022, Commissioner Mairead McGuinness announced a comprehensive assessment of the framework to assess potential shortcomings – focusing on legal certainty, the useability of the regulation and its ability to play its part in tackling greenwashing. The open and targeted public consultations are an important part of this assessment. They will be complemented by workshops and roundtables, enabling stakeholders to submit further input.

Page contentsPage contents The Taxonomy Regulation gives the Commission the power to adopt delegated and implementing acts to specify what competent authorities and market participants need to do to comply with the obligations laid down in the regulation. The Taxonomy Regulation tasks the Commission with establishing the actual list of environmentally sustainable activities by defining technical screening criteria for each environmental objective through delegated acts. The Commission launched an educational and user-friendly website – the EU taxonomy navigator - offering a series of online tools to help users better understand what the EU taxonomy is in a simple and practical manner, which activities/sectors and technical screening criteria are covered, and how the reporting obligations work in practice.

The Commission has also adopted amendments to the Taxonomy Disclosures Delegated Act and to the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, covering the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The criteria are informed to a very large extent by the recommendations of the Platform on Sustainable Finance, published in March and November 2022. The adopted texts were published in the Official Journal of the EU on 21 November 2023 and will apply as of January 2024.

As a first step, the Joint Research Centre – the in-house science and knowledge service of the Commission – drafted a technical report on the ‘do no significant harm’ aspects of nuclear energy. This publication is a Science for Policy report by the JRC, which aims to provide evidence-based scientific support to the European policymaking process. The scientific report does not imply a policy position of the European Commission. This report has been reviewed by two sets of experts, the Group of Experts on radiation protection and waste management under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks on environmental impacts. Their reviews are available below. The reports and these reviews will inform the Commission’s decision making.

Page contentsPage contents What the EU is doing and why The EU taxonomy is a cornerstone of the EU’s sustainable finance framework and an important market transparency tool. It helps direct investments to the economic activities most needed for the transition, in line with the European Green Deal objectives. The taxonomy is a classification system that defines criteria for economic activities that are aligned with a net zero trajectory by 2050 and the broader environmental goals other than climate.In order to meet the EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 and reach the objectives of the European green deal, it is vital that we direct investments towards sustainable projects and activities. To achieve this, a common language and a clear definition of what is ‘sustainable’ is needed. This is why the action plan on financing sustainable growth called for the creation of a common classification system for sustainable economic activities, or an “EU taxonomy”. The EU taxonomy allows financial and non-financial companies to share a common definition of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable.In this way, it plays an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment, by creating security for investors, protecting private investors from greenwashing, helping companies become more climate-friendly and mitigating market fragmentation. The Taxonomy Regulation entered into force on 12 July 2020. It establishes the basis for the EU taxonomy by setting out the 4 overarching conditions that an economic activity has to meet in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable. Under the Taxonomy Regulation, the Commission had to come up with the actual list of environmentally sustainable activities by defining technical screening criteria for each environmental objective through delegated and implementing acts. EU taxonomy explainedThe taxonomy's uptake on the groundFactsheet on how companies, public entities, and financial actors are using the taxonomy EU taxonomy navigator The Commission created an educational and user-friendly website offering a series of online tools to help users better understand the EU taxonomy in a simple and practical manner, ultimately facilitating its implementation and supporting companies in their reporting obligations.

Page contentsPage contents What the EU is doing and why The EU has put in place a transparency framework, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). By setting out how financial market participants have to disclose sustainability information, it helps those investors who seek to put their money into companies and projects supporting sustainability objectives to make informed choices. The SFDR is also designed to allow investors to properly assess how sustainability risks are integrated in the investment decision process. In this way, the SFDR contributes to one of the EU’s big political objectives: attracting private funding to help Europe make the shift to a net-zero economy. The European Commission is currently carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the framework, looking at issues such as legal certainty, usability and how the Regulation can play its part in tackling green-washing.

Relevant legislation Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR) - 2019/2088/EUThe SFDR requires financial market participants and financial advisers to inform investors about how they consider the sustainability risks that can affect the value of and return on their investments (‘outside-in’ effect) and the adverse impacts that such investments have on the environment and society (‘inside-out’). Market participants have to make this information available with regard to specific products, but also relating to their respective firm as a whole. They have to do so via their websites, in product pre-contractual documents and in annual reports.The Regulation does not force market participants to consider green criteria when investing. Rather, it sets out rules that require them to justify the sustainability claims that they make in relation to their financial products.

A new law on sustainability requirements for a wide range of everyday household products has entered into force in the EU.The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) will enable requirements to be set with the aim to ensure products last longer, are easier to repair and recycle, contain fewer problematic chemicals and more recycled materials, and are more energy and resource-efficient. This can mean lower costs and less hassle for consumers.It will encourage companies to bring more sustainable products to the EU market, provide them with a level playing field, and boost the competitiveness of sustainability frontrunners. It will also enhance the viability of remanufacturing, refurbishment, and recycling activities, which have significant job creation potential.Consumers and the environment pay the price for badly designed and short-lived products. The ESPR builds on the success of the existing Ecodesign Directive, which has already helped EU households save over €200 per year on average mainly by making products more energy efficient.The ESPR will now extend this approach to a much broader range of products, and enable far-reaching performance and information ‘ecodesign requirements’ to be set on a wide range of areas, such as:Product durability, reusability, upgradability and reparabilityThe presence of substances that hinder circularityEnergy and resource efficiencyRecycled contentRemanufacturing and recyclingCarbon and environmental footprintsInformation requirements, including a Digital Product PassportRules for making products more sustainable under the EPSR will be rolled out progressively for individual product groups or for several product groups with similar characteristics. The rules will be tailored to the specific groups, for example, rules for smartphones, shoes or tyres will not be the same. They will be developed based on scientific evidence, economic analysis and stakeholder consultation, and once in place will apply to all those wanting to sell on the EU market.To make sure everyone knows what to expect, and that companies have enough time to prepare, the Commission will publish multiannual working plans, listing the products and measures to be addressed. The first working plan will be adopted within nine months, and in addition to energy-related products is likely to include highly impactful products, such as clothes, furniture, steel, aluminium, tyres, and ICT products. The ESPR will also roll out new cross-cutting measures to reinforce sustainable consumption and production patterns for products, as well as to strengthen enforcement - a key element ensuring a level playing field on the Single Market. For the first time in the EU, novel Digital Product Passport requirements will be launched for all products regulated under the ESPR. The ‘passport' will be a scannable tag on products, providing easy access to product sustainability information. This should help consumers make more sustainable product choices, prolong product lifetimes, and generate profits and jobs through circular business practices. It will also help authorities enforce the legal requirements more effectively. The ESPR also contains new measures to end the immensely wasteful and environmentally harmful practice of destroying unsold consumer products, including potential obligations on companies to take measures to prevent this practice. In addition, a direct ban on the destruction of unsold textiles and footwear products will be introduced, with derogations for small companies and a transition period for medium-sized ones. Over time, other sectors could be covered by such bans, if needed. If large companies do destroy unsold products, they will need to inform publicly know how many, and why. Next stepsWork will now focus on implementing the ESPR. One of the first steps will be for the Commission to establish the Ecodesign Forum, which will be the main arena for gathering stakeholder input in the ESPR process. The Commission will then consult on and adopt the first ESPR working plan. Quotes Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, Maroš Šefčovič, said: “Today we set the bar higher to ensure that resource and energy-efficient products become the norm on the EU market. The Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation is a world-leading initiative. Having products that are repairable, recyclable and increasingly made of recycled materials provides new business opportunities, creates innovative jobs and offers more value for consumers. We will now swiftly roll out Ecodesign product rules – starting with the products that have the biggest environmental impact and the biggest potential for energy savings and circularity.” Commissioner for Energy, Kadri Simson, said:“EU rules have a proven track record of making everyday household products more energy efficient and have delivered around half of the EU’s energy savings, with a direct impact on consumers’ household bills. Energy efficiency measures are a concrete way for citizens to play an active role in the clean energy transition, and to directly benefit from it.”BackgroundOn 30 March 2022, the European Commission proposed an Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) as part of the Commission's Circular Economy Action Plan under the European Green Deal.Products use up massive amounts of materials, energy and other resources and cause significant environmental impacts throughout their lifecycle, from the extraction of raw materials, to manufacture, transport, use and end of life. Half of global greenhouse gases and 90% of biodiversity loss are caused by extracting and processing primary raw materials. Negative environmental impacts include significant resource depletion, generation of greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution. A recent JRC study demonstrated that global planetary boundaries are close to or are already being surpassed in several impact categories. The EU needs to act now to reverse these trends.The objective of the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation is to make sustainable products the norm on the EU market and reduce their overall environmental and climate impacts. The ‘take-make-use-dispose' model can be avoided, and much of a product's environmental impact is determined at the design stage. The new Regulation will extend the existing Ecodesign framework in two ways: first, to cover the broadest possible range of products; and second, where appropriate, to broaden the scope of the requirements with which products are to comply.

Consumption in the EU can therefore be a major cause of climate change and pollution.The ESPR is part of a package of measures that are central to achieving the objectives of the 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan. They will contribute to helping the EU reach its environmental and climate goals, doubling its circularity rate of material use and to achieving its energy efficiency targets by 2030.Discover the new Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation Page contentsPage contents Objectives The ESPR aims to significantly improve the circularity, energy performance and other environmental sustainability aspects of products placed on the EU market.By doing so, a significant step will be taken towards better protecting our planet, fostering more sustainable business models and strengthening the overall competitiveness and resilience of the EU economy.A sustainable product is likely to display one or more of the following characteristics:-Uses less energyLasts longerCan be easily repairedParts can be easily disassembled and put to further useContains fewer substances of concernCan be easily recycledContains more recycled contentHas a lower carbon and environmental footprint over its lifecycle Law The ESPR replaces the current Ecodesign Directive 2009/125/EC and establishes a framework for setting ecodesign requirements on specific product groups.It enables the setting of performance and information conditions – known as ‘ecodesign requirements’ – for almost all categories of physical goods (with some exceptions, such as food and feed, as defined in Regulation 178/2002), including to:-Improve product durability, reusability, upgradability and reparabilityMake products more energy and resource-efficientAddress the presence of substances that inhibit circularityIncrease recycled contentMake products easier to remanufacture and recycleSet rules on carbon and environmental footprintsImprove the availability of information on product sustainabilityFor groups of products that share enough common characteristics, the framework allows horizontal rules to be set.The ESPR also contains a number of other new measures:- Digital Product PassportThe ESPR will introduce a Digital Product Passport (DPP), a digital identity card for products, components, and materials, which will store relevant information to support products’ sustainability, promote their circularity and strengthen legal compliance. This information will be accessible electronically, making it easier for consumers, manufacturers, and authorities to make more informed decisions related to sustainability, circularity and regulatory compliance. It will allow custom authorities to perform automatic checks on the existence and authenticity of the DPPs of imported products.Information to be included in the DPP will be identified by the Commission, in close consultation with all relevant stakeholders, and will depend on the specific product in question.

For the first time in the EU, the ESPR introduces measures to address this practice, by introducing a ban on the destruction of unsold textiles and footwear, and opening the way for similar bans in other sectors, if evidence shows they are needed. It will require large and eventually medium-sized companies across all product sectors to disclose annual information on their website, such as the number and weight of products they discard, as well as their reasons for doing so.Green Public ProcurementPublic authorities in the EU spend around €1.8 trillion purchasing works, goods and services.The ESPR will help steer these funds in a more sustainable direction, by enabling mandatory Green Public Procurement criteria to be set for EU authorities who purchase the products that it will regulate.This has the potential to significantly boost demand for sustainable products, in turn, further incentivising companies to invest in this area. Implementation The ESPR is a framework legislation, meaning concrete product rules will be decided progressively over time, on a product-by-product basis, or horizontally, on the basis of groups of products with similar characteristics. The process will begin with a prioritisation exercise, followed by publication of a working plan sets out the products and measures to be addressed under the ESPR over a given time period. Development of product rules will then start, based on inclusive planning, detailed impact assessments and regular stakeholder consultation. This will happen through an Ecodesign Forum.Find out more about the implementation of the ESPR here.

Is your business prepared? Under the new recycling legislation, businesses will be required to separate their dry recycling and food waste from their general waste by law. In line with the UK government’s broader initiative to standardise recycling practices under the Environment Act (2021), this new legislation is aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the commercial sector and promoting sustainability. In this article, we break down the core stipulations of this incoming legislation into simple terms, helping your business to prepare for the law changes. Read on to find out more. What is the new recycling legislation? According to the Environment Act 2021 (Commencement No. 9 and Transitional Provisions) Regulations 2024, the new legislation mandates the following: Businesses in England of 10 employees or more producing more than 5 kg of food waste per week (equivalent to the weight of a bowling ball) must arrange for its separate collection by a licensed waste carrier. (‘Food waste’ is defined to include a wide range of biodegradable materials, such as fruit and vegetable peels, bones, eggshells, coffee grounds, and even tea bags) Dry waste recycling must be separate from the general waste Key Requirements of the New UK Recycling Laws The new recycling laws require businesses to segregate the following materials for recycling: Glass: Such as empty drink bottles and rinsed food jars. Metal: Including drink cans, food tins, empty aerosols, aluminium foil, trays, and tubes. Plastic: For example rinsed empty food containers and bottles. Paper and Cardboard. Cartons: For food, drinks, and other liquids. Food Waste. These materials must be kept separate to ensure they are not contaminated by non-recyclable waste, maximising their potential for recycling. Who is affected by the new recycling laws? The legislation specifies that it applies to all ‘relevant non-domestic premises located in the area of an English waste collection authority’. To make this simpler, if you’re a business you will be required by law to have separate collections for both recycling and food waste in place by the end of March 2025 March 31st 2025. This is the official deadline for businesses of 10 people or more, including public and third-sector organisations like schools, hospitals, and prisons. Since the incoming legislation on separate recycling and food waste collections impacts a wide range of sectors — including restaurants, cafes, pubs, bakeries, care homes, offices, and transport hubs — it is strongly advised that, even if your business is small, you start separating recyclable materials and food waste as soon as possible. Doing so will help reduce costs and contribute to environmental sustainability. Why is new recycling and food waste legislation being introduced? Did you know that 9.5 million tonnes of food waste is discarded annually in the UK, with a significant portion of this ending up in landfills? This not only contributes to greenhouse gas emissions but also represents a lost opportunity to recycle valuable organic materials. Similarly, recyclable materials are often disposed of improperly, adding to landfill waste and environmental damage. The new regulations are being introduced to address these issues by requiring businesses to have separate recycling and food waste collections. According to the House of Commons’ Food Waste in the UK Report (April, 2024), “In England, there are no mandatory food waste reduction targets.” But that is set to change. The UK Government does, however, support voluntary initiatives, including the Courtauld Commitment 2030 which proposes the following: A 50% per capita reduction in food waste by 2030 vs the UK 2007 baseline (covering manufacture, retail, hospitality and food service, and household). The new food waste legislation therefore stands as a critical step toward achieving that goal and implementing more rigid reduction targets for food waste in England. Collected food waste is intended for anaerobic digestion or composting, processes that convert waste into valuable resources like biofuel and digestate. Recyclable materials are also processed into new products. These resources contribute to a circular economy, reducing landfill waste and supporting the production of renewable energy and natural fertilisers. So, by diverting food waste from landfills, the new legislation ultimately aims to help reduce environmental impact, lower waste management costs, and support renewable energy and fertiliser production. Preparing your business for the new waste laws If your business produces more than 5kg of food waste per week and has more than 10 employees, it’s essential to start preparing for the law changes now. Regardless of your size or sector, here’s how you can get ahead when it comes to staying on the right side of the law about food and recycling waste. 1. Start reducing your food waste A problem halved is … well, a problem halved. It becomes much easier to manage your food waste if there is less waste to begin with. So, starting with reducing the amount of food left to spoil or rot is key. In organisations, this can be as easy as regular reminders to your staff — in the form of posters, signs, or training — to be mindful of expiration dates and preserving food properly e.g. putting sandwiches from a client lunch away into the fridges immediately to prevent spoil. 2. Start separating your waste It’s better to start sooner rather than later and get your staff into the habit of separating recyclables and food waste from general waste early on. Make sure that your workforce is aware of the general rules of thumb when it comes to what can and can’t be recycled in a food bin, as well as your dry recycling, and encourage a positive attitude towards proper waste disposal. Attitudinal change does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to waste management in an organisation. Of course, there is no point separating the two without making suitable recyclable and food waste collection arrangements — but that’s where we come in. 3.

Duty of CareEnvironmental Protection ActEU Landfill DirectiveHazardous Waste RegulationPackaging Waste RegulationsPre-Treatment of WasteUK Waste RegulationWaste Transfer NotesThe Waste Electrical & Electronic Equipment DirectiveRecycling and Food waste legislation changes 2025 Duty of Care Section 34 of The Environmental Protection Act 1990 imposes a duty of care on persons concerned with handling waste. This Duty of Care affects anyone who produces, imports, carries, keeps, treats or disposes of controlled waste, or as a broker has control of such waste. Who is subject to the duty of care? Any person who imports, produces, carries, keeps treats or disposes of controlled waste or, as a broker, has control of such waste is subject to the Duty of Care with respect to such wastes. For more information click here. Environmental Protection Act The Environmental Protection Act 1990, a UK act of parliament relating to controlled wastes is the successor to the Control of Pollution Act 1974 and makes provision for the management of pollution from industrial processes. The Environmental Protection Act deals with issues relating to waste on land, defining all aspects of waste management and places a duty on local authorities to collect waste. As a business, you have a duty to ensure that any waste your company produces is handled safely and within the law. This is your ‘duty of care’ and it applies to anyone who produces, imports, transports, stores, treats or disposes of controlled waste from businesses or industries. For more information click here. EU Landfill Directive The Landfill Directive aims to reduce reliance on landfill as a disposal option. It seeks to decrease the environmental impacts of landfills and reduce the risk to human health while imposing a consistent minimum standard for landfills across the EU. The Landfill Directive: Sets minimum standards for the location, design, construction and operation of landfills. Sets targets for the diversion of Biodegradable Municipal Waste (BMW) from landfill things will run. Controls the nature of waste accepted for landfill. It defines the different categories of waste (municipal waste, hazardous waste, non-hazardous waste and inert waste) and applies to all landfills, defined as waste disposal sites for the deposit of waste onto or into the land. For more information click here. Hazardous Waste Regulation The Hazardous Waste Regulations 2005 came into force and were produced not only as part of a framework for the controlled management of Hazardous Waste but to replace the Special Waste Regulations. The new hazardous waste definition covers a much wider range of waste and is far broader than that of special waste. It is commonly defined as containing substances or possessing properties that may make it harmful to human health or the surrounding environment but this does not mean that such waste is toxic imminently as it could be prolonged over a period of time. The Hazardous Waste Regulation includes: Fluorescent Tubes Television sets Fridges PC Monitors Batteries Aerosols & Paint Contaminated Soils For more information click here. As of the 1st April, the changes to the Hazardous Waste Premise Registration Procedure will take effect, to find out how this will affect your business. Click here for more information. Packaging Waste Regulations The Packaging Waste Regulations were introduced in the UK in 1997 to meet the requirements of the European Directive on packaging and packaging waste, with the aim to not only increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in a consistent way but to reduce the amount of packaging used all together. In 2011 10.8 million tonnes packaging waste was disposed of in the UK, with 67% being recovered. For more information click here. Pre-Treatment of Waste In 2007, under the new European-wide legislation, inert or non-hazardous wastes must be treated before disposal. The requirement to treat waste is part of the main aim of the Landfill Directive to try and prevent or reduce as far as possible the negative effects on the environment. This change aims to help increase waste recycling and recovery and to help reduce potentially polluting emissions from landfills. For the waste to be seen as pre-treated it must comply with the definition of treatment, this involves a three-point test in which the proposed treatment option must be accessed by: The waste must be treated by a physical, thermal, chemical or biological process which includes sorting. The process must change the characteristics of the waste, and must do so in order to: Reduce the volume of waste; or Reduce its hazardous nature; or Facilitate its handling; or Enhance its recovery. For more information click here. UK Waste Regulation Since January 1st 2015, UK waste regulations have required businesses to separate recyclable materials (paper, plastic & glass) from other waste. This amendment to the EU Waste Framework Directive is to ensure improvement to the quality and quantity of recycling across the UK. It means that businesses should ensure that all dry mixed recyclables (paper, plastic & glass) produced by your business are collected separately from other waste such as food and general waste. For more information click here. Waste Transfer Notes Any waste transfer must be accompanied by a written Waste Transfer Note (WTN) in which the waste is sufficiently and accurately described. Waste Transfer Notes must be kept for at least two years. Countrystyle Recycling is a licensed waste carrier. Countrystyle works with its customers to help them comply with all relevant waste management legislation. For more information click here. The Waste and Electrical & Electronic Equipment Directive The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) was introduced in January 2007. The WEEE Directive aims to reduce the amount of electrical and electronic equipment being produced and to encourage everyone to reuse, recycle and recover it. For more information click here. Recycling and Food waste legislation changes March 2025 Starting March 31, 2025, new recycling and food waste laws will be enforced across England, requiring businesses to separate dry recycling and food waste from their general waste. This shift, part of the UK government’s sustainability push, aims to cut environmental impact and boost recycling. Our blog breaks down what these changes mean for your business, including key dates, who is affected, and how to prepare.

Waste legislation covers all hazardous and non-hazardous waste types including electronic and construction waste. It is the responsibility of the waste producers (those whose waste is required to be disposed of) to ensure that legislation is upheld; with all relevant permits obtained, paperwork completed and records kept, with failure to comply potentially resulting in penalties. Detailed below is a small selection of some of the waste legislation that you and your business should be aware of, what they cover and what you need to do to comply. This is not a comprehensive list. Waste Management regulations are very complex and require knowledge and expertise to ensure compliance. We would recommend you seek advice from a waste consultant to help you dispose of your waste properly. VIEW ALL WASTE SERVICES Classifying Waste Classifying your waste is the important first step in correctly managing and disposing of your waste. All waste must be identified and classified before it is sent for recycling or disposal and is a requirement for all businesses that generate waste of any kind.There are several classifications to waste, however first it must be assessed whether it is hazardous or contains persistent organic pollutants (POPs) as these types of waste must never be mixed with non-hazardous waste or another hazardous waste; this is not only illegal and your business could incur fines, it is potentially dangerous to health and the environment.Types of hazardous and non-hazardous waste have a classification code assigned to them, also referred to as LoW (List of Waste) or EWC (European Waste Catalogue) codes that allow waste managers to know how to correctly handle, dispose of, or recycle each particular type. There are approximately 650 different codes assigned, in 20 chapters and then further divided into categories. Some of the more common ones are: 19 12 01 - Paper and Cardboard 20 03 01 - Mixed Municipal Waste Including Mixed Packaging 20 01 02 - Glass Waste 17 06 05* - Construction Materials Containing Asbestos An asterisk (*) denotes that this material is considered hazardous waste and should therefore be handled and disposed of carefully and through the appropriate channels. It's important to note that incorrect use or categorisation of waste is a breach of the waste duty of care regulations, so it's important that the waste disposer correctly identifies the materials in the waste. For further information on the classification of waste and the codes associated with these, please refer to the Government guidelines. VIEW ALL WASTE SERVICES Duty of Care/Waste Transfer Notes Duty of Care is the legal obligation for anyone (householders and businesses) that produces, carries, processes or disposes of waste to ensure that it is handled appropriately and responsibly. Businesses must also take steps to minimise the impact of the waste that they generate, including recycling, reusing and sustainable practices. The waste producer or holder is obliged to describe their waste correctly in accordance with WM3. Waste Transfer Notes (WTNs) are documents required by law as part of Duty of Care regulations, that provide a record of the transfer of waste from one person or organisation to another. The WTN must provide details about the waste being transferred, including the type and quantity of waste, the name and address of the person transferring the waste, the name and address of the person receiving the waste, and a description of the steps that will be taken to manage the waste.WTNs are an important part of waste management as they provide an accurate description of the waste when it is transferred to another person. Waste Transfer Notes provide a paper trail that tracks the movement of waste and provides evidence that it is being properly treated and disposed of for local council enforcement officers and the Environment Agency.To learn more about Waste Duty Notes visit the Government WTN guide Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) The Environmental Protection Act 1990 is designed to regulate and manage waste disposal and pollution, in order to protect the environment and public health by minimising the environmental impact of businesses. The waste duty of care, issued under section 34(7) of the Environmental Protection Act provides a framework for waste management with a focus on handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste, and measures to prevent pollution and promote sustainable development. The EPA is applicable to all individuals, businesses, and organisations that generate and handle waste of all types; including inert, non-hazardous and hazardous, commercial and industrial waste, and non-compliance can incur penalties and possible imprisonment. By working with Hills Waste, we can help you to ensure that your business upholds The Environmental Protection Act 1990 guidance - learn more about our commitment to sustainability. EU Landfill Directive The EU Landfill Directive provides strict guidelines for the management of landfill sites, defining the different types of landfill and the waste they can and cannot accept, in order to protect health and the environment, with rigid requirements for landfill areas and objectives to reduce its use in favour of other methods. This Directive also outlines the requirement for most inert or non-hazardous waste to need pre-treatment. This is to ensure the waste being disposed of is compliant with the waste hierarchy, even if that treatment is simply segregation. The waste hierarchy is important to consider when making decisions about how to dispose of waste. It prioritises different methods of reducing the volume of waste, with landfill being the least desirable option. All businesses should make a concerted effort to reduce the amount of waste they generate, and when waste is generated, other disposal options such as reuse of materials or recycling should be explored before landfill disposal is considered. In order to ensure that all generated waste is disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner, businesses should strive to implement a waste management strategy that follows the waste hierarchy and is tailored to their specific needs. Learn more about the EU Landfill Directive. Landfill Tax Regulations 1996 Landfill tax is a tax applied on the disposal of all waste to landfill and is controlled and collected by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) and applies to England and Northern Ireland. All waste entering landfill is subject to Landfill Tax with very few exemptions, so it encourages businesses to exercise every effort to reduce the amount of waste they produce and adopt suitable non-landfill waste management solutions such as; recycling, re-use and composting. Landfill tax is generally charged per tonne of waste disposed and is subject to a yearly increase. Some suitable qualifying materials may attract a lower per tonne rate. Waste attracting the lower rate must conform to the Qualifying Material Order 2011, these materials include. Naturally occurring rocks and soils Ceramic or concrete materials Minerals Furnace slags Ash Low activity inorganic compounds Calcium sulphate When a request is made for a lower rate of landfill tax to be applied, Hills Waste Solutions will conduct pre-acceptance waste checks, details of the waste generation will be required alongside laboratory testing. As your Waste Management partner, Hills Waste Solutions will also conduct sampling and laboratory analysis in accordance with LFT 1 (Landfill Tax Guidelines) to ensure compliance. Should the material not be compliant with the qualifying material order, the client will be informed, the waste may be returned, or disposed at the facility and standard rate tax applied. If the waste is hazardous the waste can be forwarded to a suitable permitted facility. To learn more about Landfill Tax and it's obligations , visit gov.uk. Hazardous Waste Regulations 2005 The responsible handling and disposal of hazardous waste, such as batteries, asbestos, and chemicals, is important in order to avoid danger to health and damage to the environment. The Hazardous Waste Regulations 2005; that are enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency, provide a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure that hazardous waste is handled and disposed of in a safe and responsible manner. These regulations also cover the transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste, as well as the correct permits and record keeping. All businesses must identify hazardous waste and ensure that it is stored appropriately separately from other types of waste and that it is handled and collected by specialist registered waste carriers. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in prosecution and fines. Learn more about our hazardous waste management services to ensure that your business adheres to all regulations. Packaging Waste Regulations Packaging Waste Regulations are guidelines that aim to reduce the amount of plastic packaging/filling waste and raw packaging material waste that is sent to landfill and to promote its reuse and recycling. These regulations apply to businesses such as those in the manufacturing and production sector which handle 50 tonnes or more of packaging materials or packaging annually or have a turnover of more than £2 million a year. If you are eligible; as either a producer or generator of packaging waste, by law you must register your compliance to adhere to these regulations - failure to do so will result in penalties. Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) 2007 All companies, suppliers and sellers of electrical items such as computers, TVs, microwaves and telephones must adhere to WEEE regulations to ensure proper management of electronic waste, as these products contain components which can be hazardous to health and the environment if not properly handled and disposed of. Electronic waste must be separated from other types of waste and collected and treated by authorised waste carriers, failure to adhere to these regulations can result in legal action and damage to your businesses reputation. For more information on WEEE laws and regulations, visit gov.uk UK Waste Regulation 2015 - (Separate Collections (TEEP) To improve UK recycling rates, the UK Waste Regulation 2015 - (Separate Collections (TEEP)) promotes correct waste classification and separation to ensure that it is recycled and disposed of in the most appropriate way. It is the responsibility of all individuals and businesses to ensure that recyclable material such as glass, metal, paper, cardboard, and plastic is handled and stored separately to general waste and free from contamination so that it can be collected and treated by specialist waste carriers. It is the legal responsibility of all individuals and businesses to follow the waste hierarchy structure and correctly dispose of waste in the appropriate containers. Learn more about our waste container range to suit your waste needs. Animal By-Products Animal by-product handling and disposal are part of the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs and provide guidelines to ensure that animal by-products such as bones, fat, meat and eggs are handled, processed, stored and disposed of correctly to protect health and the environment. Animal by-products are divided into three categories that determine how they are managed; ABP 1 and ABP 2 are considered high-risk and include contaminated carcases, animals from zoos, and livestock. ABP 3 includes low risk waste such as domestic catering waste, bones, fat, meat and eggs. It is the responsibility of individuals and businesses that generate animal by-products of all kinds to categorise, store separately from other waste types, and dispose of correctly to maintain hygiene and to avoid potential fines. Approximately 1.1m tonnes* of food waste is produced annually by the hospitality and food service industry, and with that Category 3 Animal by-products. By partnering with a waste management company such as Hills Waste Solutions, you can ensure that your food waste is responsibly handled and treated.To learn more, visit the government guidance for animal by-product disposal. *Resources: https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/food-waste-in-the-uk/ Waste Carriers It is the legal responsibility of all individuals, businesses and organisations to comply with waste legislation, by partnering with a trusted, experienced, and suitably permitted and licenced waste carrier such as Hills Waste Solutions, you can ensure the complete end-to-end process is managed responsibly and follows all guidance and legalities.

Once passed, these regulations will require new circular partnerships between battery manufacturers and recyclers. Here, we present a broad outline of the proposed legislation. Among other measures, recycling will need to increase, more recycled materials will be required in the production of new batteries and \"battery passports\" will be introduced to ensure traceability. More stringent requirements The EU's current battery legislation, introduced in 2006, has become outdated and been interpreted and implemented in different ways by the member states. The new legislation will be more specific. The proposal contains 79 binding articles, which will prevent EU countries from implementing the legislation in different ways and covers all types of portable, starter, vehicle, and industrial batteries. These new requirements will affect the manufacture, design, labelling, traceability, collection, re-use, and recycling of batteries throughout their lifecycle. The limits of this future legislation are still being determined, although additional requirements are expected in the coming years. Stricter legislation will require new partnerships between industry and recyclers These measures will signal the EU’s desire to regulate how batteries are handled and ensure their material content is not lost. “The EU wants to protect the retention of critical battery materials in the European value chain so that they are sufficient for tomorrow's electrified cars and other products”, says Marcus Martinsson, Business area manager batteries at Stena Recycling. Stena Recycling has been involved in the EU’s consultation process and expressed its desire for fair legislation, improved working practices, and efficient resource management. contact usDo you need a solution for your batteries?Contact our experts at Stena Recycling if you would like to know more about circular battery management.Get in touch \"The legislation is driving new circular partnerships between producers and recyclers. We are embarking on an important and exciting journey with our customers. Our ongoing initiatives create value for our customers and the planet, and are in line with the new legislation and developments in the battery market\"Marcus Martinsson Here is an excerpt from the EU legislative proposal: Open information on batteries and traceability Manufacturers will be required to provide access to information in control systems for automotive batteries with a capacity of 2 kWh or more. This is to facilitate the handling of these batteries and determine their suitability for reuse or recycling. The material content, the quantity of each material and its origin should be indicated on automotive and industrial batteries. From 2027, the EU will require batteries to be labelled with the name of the manufacturer, type of battery, date of manufacture, presence of hazardous substances and other information that facilitates recycling or reuse. Reconditioned or reused batteries must be accompanied by documentation regarding their status, a change of ownership certificate and technical documentation. Manufacturers will be required to include information with end-of-life batteries that minimize waste and contribute to the reuse or recycling of their material content. They must also provide information about how automotive batteries should be safely dismantled, transported and recycled. In addition, they will be obliged to disclose the environmental and health impact of battery contents. The EU is seeking to introduce an electronic battery passport for industrial and automotive batteries with a capacity of 2 kWh or more, which will contain all available information on each battery. When the status of the battery changes (e.g. due to repair or reuse), this information will need to be updated. Increased recycling and reuse It’s a current requirement that, at least, 50% of a battery’s weight must be recycled. From 2026, this requirement will increase to 65% for lithium-ion batteries and to 70% from 2031. Specific recycling requirements will also be introduced for the lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and lead content of batteries. For example, the required recycling rate for lithium will increase from 35 to 70% between 2026 and 2030. The EU is seeking to set a 90% recycling rate for cobalt, copper, nickel, and lead from 2026. Recyclers will have to report annually on the quantity of batteries they handle and recycle, as well as the recycling rates of the various materials extracted. It will also be a requirement to measure the efficiency of their recycling processes. Manufacturers will be required to increase the number of portable batteries they collect by 45% by 2026, and by 70% by 2030. The export of used batteries outside the EU will only be permitted if the recipient's battery management procedure meets EU's requirements. Increased use of recycled raw materials As early as 2027, the proposed EU legislation will require manufacturers to provide transparent information on the quantity of recycled cobalt, lithium, nickel, and lead in new car batteries. The required amount of recycled cobalt and lithium will more than double from 2030 to 2035.

September 202311 min readThis post is also available in: By Ilinca Anghelescu, Global Director Marketing Communications, EW Nutrition This may be the year that climate change has arrived in humanity’s backyard, driving home the repercussions of human action and the finite nature of our planet’s resources. More than ever, it is also becoming clear that we cannot fight climate change in our own backyard but that long-term cross-border action is imperative. With the visible threat of extreme events nearer than ever, companies and countries feel pressured to show their commitment to sustainable practices. The shape this commitment takes is, however, very different. The slew of regulations and policies directly or indirectly aimed at promoting sustainability may take the shape of water or energy management, environmental protection, specific business practice regulations, and may or may not include reporting obligations and monitoring bodies. Some international initiatives are attempting to impose such obligations, with varying degrees of success. Reading between the lines, the number of regulations is not the problem; it is the competencies in standardizing and enforcing these regulations that prove more difficult. Sustainability regulations in the European Union The European Union is both the fastest warming region (with the exception of the Arctic) and probably the most advanced in terms of regulatory pressure. It has been steadily developing not just specific regulations aimed at green growth, but also specific reporting tools to avoid greenwashing and standardize the monitoring and measuring of this commitment. The largest sustainability initiative, the EU’s Green Deal, unveiled in 2019, is a comprehensive policy framework aimed at making Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Among its objectives are reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and promoting circular economy practices. Key regulations include: European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): The EU ETS is a “cap and trade” scheme that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. It is the first and largest carbon market, covering around 45% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and is operational across the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The system works by setting a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by all participating installations. Within this cap, operators buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. The fourth phase started in January 2021 and is to continue until December 2030, however the reduction target for 2030 needs to be reassessed. Single-Use Plastics Directive: This regulation aims to reduce single-use plastics and their impact on the environment by banning certain products and promoting recycling. Circular Economy Action Plan: Designed to reduce waste and promote recycling, this plan outlines initiatives to make products more durable and easier to repair. The plan includes measures on product design, waste management, and resource efficiency. Taxonomy Regulation: This regulation establishes an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. The taxonomy defines which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable, based on their contribution to environmental objectives such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, and water protection. More recent but directly concerned with regulating and reporting sustainability in business practices are the following: Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR): The SFDR requires financial market participants and advisers to disclose information about how they integrate sustainability risks into their investment decisions, consider and disclose the adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors. Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD): This requires companies to report on a wide range of sustainability issues, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The reporting requirements will be phased in, starting from January 1, 2024, for certain large EU and EU-listed companies, and will apply to all in-scope companies by January 1, 2028. In addition to these regulations, the EU also provides financial support for sustainable projects through its Horizon Europe research and innovation program. Horizon Europe has a budget of €95.5 billion for the period 2021-2027, and a significant portion of this funding will be used to support research and innovation in areas such as climate change mitigation, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture. Sustainability regulations in the United States The United States traditionally has a more decentralized approach to regulations, with federal, state, and local governments all playing important roles. Key federal regulations and initiatives in the field of sustainability include: Clean Air Act: Enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this law aims to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This law regulates air pollution from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, and vehicles. The Clean Air Act has helped to reduce air pollution in the US by over 70% since it was passed in 1970. Clean Water Act: Also administered by the EPA, this act sets standards for water quality, aiming to protect aquatic ecosystems. This law regulates water pollution from a variety of sources, including factories, farms, and sewage treatment plants. The Clean Water Act has helped to improve water quality in the US by over 70% since it was passed in 1972. Renewable Energy Tax Credits: Also called Residential Clean Energy Credits, these incentives encourage the development and use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. More recent, targeted sustainability actions and regulations in the US include: Executive Order 14057: Issued by President Biden in 2021, the Executive Order on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability requires federal agencies to take steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy. ESG Disclosure Simplification Act: This bill, passed by the House of Representatives in 2021, would require public companies to disclose more information about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Methane Emissions Reduction Plan: The White House Action Plan, together with the Supplemental Methane Proposal put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2022, would require primarily oil and gas companies to reduce methane emissions from their operations. Sustainable Electricity Plan: This plan, released by the Department of Energy in 2022, outlines the Biden administration’s goals for increasing the use of renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. SEC Climate-Related Disclosures/ESG Investing: Prompted by the Climate Risk Disclosure Act of 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a rule proposal that would require US publicly traded companies to disclose annually how their businesses are assessing, measuring, and managing climate-related risks. This would include climate-related risks and their material impacts on the registrant’s business, strategy, and outlook; governance of climate-related risks; greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions; certain climate-related financial statement metrics and related disclosures; information about climate-related targets and goals, and transition plan, if any. Some companies would have to already start reporting in 2023 for 2023. However, it is likely the proposal will undergo several rounds of revisions. In addition to these federal laws, there are also a number of state and local sustainability regulations. U.S. regulations generally lack cohesion, with the federal government’s role fluctuating depending on the administration in power. Still, there is growing momentum towards sustainability, driven by grassroots movements and corporate initiatives. Sustainability regulations in China China, the world’s largest polluter, faces significant sustainability challenges as it grapples with rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth. It has made substantial progress, particularly in renewable energy adoption, but still faces challenges of implementation. Carbon Neutrality Commitment: In September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced China’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. This ambitious goal involves reducing carbon emissions to net-zero by mid-century. Renewable Energy Development: China is a global leader in renewable energy deployment. It has set targets for increasing the share of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower in its energy mix. Initiatives include the National Renewable Energy Development Plan and the 13th Five-Year Plan for Energy Development. Emissions Trading System (ETS): China has launched a national carbon emissions trading system, which is the world’s largest such program. It caps emissions from certain industries and encourages emission reductions through trading of carbon allowances. Green Finance Initiatives: The country is promoting green finance to support sustainable development. Initiatives include green bond issuance, guidelines for green lending, and incentives for sustainable investment. Air Quality Improvement: The “Blue Sky” campaign aims to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities through stricter emissions standards, promotion of cleaner energy sources, and transitioning from coal to natural gas. The campaign appears to have had significant impact. Sustainable transportation and circular economy: Initiatives to promote electric vehicles (EVs) and public transportation include subsidies for EV purchases, charging infrastructure development, and incentives for green vehicle production. China is also working on promoting a circular economy by reducing waste, improving resource efficiency, and encouraging recycling. The Circular Economy Promotion Law was passed in 2008. Environmental Protection Laws and Regulations: China has strengthened its environmental laws and regulations to address pollution and environmental degradation. This includes revisions to the Environmental Protection Law and stricter enforcement. These sustainability regulations, plans, and actions reflect China’s efforts to address pressing environmental challenges, transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy, and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. Results are varied but the sheer scale of China’s pollution make the success of these initiatives a matter of global concern. Sustainability regulations in India Prompted by very tangible threats, India, recently crowned the world’s most populous country, has been fighting climate change for several decades, although not necessarily under one umbrella of sustainability. Moreover, there are currently no regulations that mandate sustainability reporting in India. However, Indian regulators are revising its existing environmental laws and plans, which will likely result in more stringent requirements for companies. Instead of reporting requirements, India provides support through various sustainability-related programs and legislation. National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC): Launched in 2008, the NAPCC outlines the country’s strategy to combat climate change. It consists of eight national missions focused on various aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation, including solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, and forestry. Renewable Energy Initiatives: India has set ambitious targets for increasing its renewable energy capacity, including solar and wind power. Initiatives like the National Solar Mission aim to promote clean energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable Agriculture Initiatives: Programs like the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) promote sustainable farming practices, soil health management, and water-use efficiency in agriculture. National Clean Air Program (NCAP): India’s NCAP, launched in 2019, aims to improve air quality in major cities by reducing particulate matter and other air pollutants. It includes measures to control emissions from industries, vehicles, and biomass burning. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP): India has developed an NBSAP to conserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable use of natural resources. Water Resource Management: India has various initiatives and programs to address water-related challenges, including river rejuvenation projects, watershed development, and efforts to improve water-use efficiency in agriculture. Sustainable Transportation: The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme promotes the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations: India has a regulatory framework for conducting EIAs for various development projects to assess and mitigate their environmental impacts. Plastic Waste Management Rules: India has implemented rules to manage and reduce plastic waste, including restrictions on single-use plastics. National Mission for Sustainable Habitat (NMSH): This mission focuses on promoting sustainable urban planning and development, energy efficiency in buildings, and waste management in urban areas. India’s approach is comprehensive but at the moment focuses on top-down actions. As in China, market players are at present not required to disclose any climate-related impact or information. International sustainability regulations International organizations play a crucial role in coordinating global sustainability efforts. The United Nations and its agencies, particularly the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty and organization established to address the issue of global climate change adopted in 1992, have spearheaded international sustainability regulations, of which the most impactful are mentioned below. The Paris Agreement: Signed in 2015, the agreement represents a global commitment to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and aiming to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 196 nations have agreed on its goals, as well as committed to specific targets and standards of accountability. The Paris Agreement is part of the UNFCCC. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs are a set of 17 goals that aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. They provide a framework for companies to align their business strategies with sustainable development objectives. These goals were adopted by all United Nations Member States in September 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): The TCFD is a voluntary initiative that provides recommendations for companies to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities in their financial filings. The TCFD was founded by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, in December 2015. The TCFD encourages organizations to conduct scenario analysis, which involves assessing the potential financial impact of different climate-related scenarios, including both transition risks (related to policy and market changes) and physical risks (related to climate impacts like extreme weather events). The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) issued the first two sustainability standards, the IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. They will theoretically become effective on or after January 1, 2024. If jurisdictions challenge or delay bringing them into law, the effective date may well be later. IFRS S1 provides a set of disclosure requirements designed to enable companies to communicate to investors about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities they face over the short, medium and long term. IFRS S2 sets out specific climate-related disclosures and is designed to be used with IFRS S1. Both fully incorporate the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Conclusion China, the US, and India have been, for a while now, the largest polluter nations. However, statistics do not look at the indirect pollution cost of countries that produce abroad for internal consumption. If we take that cost into consideration, it becomes evident that sustainability regulations at both national and international level are crucial for addressing environmental and social challenges. Regulations alone are obviously not enough. Strict enforcement and monitoring are what is going to transform national and supra-national entities, regional authorities, businesses, communities, and individuals into responsible actors.

Emissions Trading System (ETS): China has launched a national carbon emissions trading system, which is the world’s largest such program. It caps emissions from certain industries and encourages emission reductions through trading of carbon allowances. Green Finance Initiatives: The country is promoting green finance to support sustainable development. Initiatives include green bond issuance, guidelines for green lending, and incentives for sustainable investment. Air Quality Improvement: The “Blue Sky” campaign aims to reduce air pollution in Chinese cities through stricter emissions standards, promotion of cleaner energy sources, and transitioning from coal to natural gas. The campaign appears to have had significant impact. Sustainable transportation and circular economy: Initiatives to promote electric vehicles (EVs) and public transportation include subsidies for EV purchases, charging infrastructure development, and incentives for green vehicle production. China is also working on promoting a circular economy by reducing waste, improving resource efficiency, and encouraging recycling. The Circular Economy Promotion Law was passed in 2008. Environmental Protection Laws and Regulations: China has strengthened its environmental laws and regulations to address pollution and environmental degradation. This includes revisions to the Environmental Protection Law and stricter enforcement. These sustainability regulations, plans, and actions reflect China’s efforts to address pressing environmental challenges, transition to a more sustainable and low-carbon economy, and contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. Results are varied but the sheer scale of China’s pollution make the success of these initiatives a matter of global concern. Sustainability regulations in India Prompted by very tangible threats, India, recently crowned the world’s most populous country, has been fighting climate change for several decades, although not necessarily under one umbrella of sustainability. Moreover, there are currently no regulations that mandate sustainability reporting in India. However, Indian regulators are revising its existing environmental laws and plans, which will likely result in more stringent requirements for companies. Instead of reporting requirements, India provides support through various sustainability-related programs and legislation. National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC): Launched in 2008, the NAPCC outlines the country’s strategy to combat climate change. It consists of eight national missions focused on various aspects of climate change mitigation and adaptation, including solar energy, energy efficiency, water, agriculture, and forestry. Renewable Energy Initiatives: India has set ambitious targets for increasing its renewable energy capacity, including solar and wind power. Initiatives like the National Solar Mission aim to promote clean energy sources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable Agriculture Initiatives: Programs like the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) promote sustainable farming practices, soil health management, and water-use efficiency in agriculture. National Clean Air Program (NCAP): India’s NCAP, launched in 2019, aims to improve air quality in major cities by reducing particulate matter and other air pollutants. It includes measures to control emissions from industries, vehicles, and biomass burning. National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP): India has developed an NBSAP to conserve biodiversity, protect ecosystems, and promote sustainable use of natural resources. Water Resource Management: India has various initiatives and programs to address water-related challenges, including river rejuvenation projects, watershed development, and efforts to improve water-use efficiency in agriculture. Sustainable Transportation: The Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme promotes the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulations: India has a regulatory framework for conducting EIAs for various development projects to assess and mitigate their environmental impacts. Plastic Waste Management Rules: India has implemented rules to manage and reduce plastic waste, including restrictions on single-use plastics. National Mission for Sustainable Habitat (NMSH): This mission focuses on promoting sustainable urban planning and development, energy efficiency in buildings, and waste management in urban areas. India’s approach is comprehensive but at the moment focuses on top-down actions. As in China, market players are at present not required to disclose any climate-related impact or information. International sustainability regulations International organizations play a crucial role in coordinating global sustainability efforts. The United Nations and its agencies, particularly the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty and organization established to address the issue of global climate change adopted in 1992, have spearheaded international sustainability regulations, of which the most impactful are mentioned below. The Paris Agreement: Signed in 2015, the agreement represents a global commitment to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and aiming to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 196 nations have agreed on its goals, as well as committed to specific targets and standards of accountability. The Paris Agreement is part of the UNFCCC. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): The SDGs are a set of 17 goals that aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all. They provide a framework for companies to align their business strategies with sustainable development objectives. These goals were adopted by all United Nations Member States in September 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): The TCFD is a voluntary initiative that provides recommendations for companies to disclose climate-related risks and opportunities in their financial filings. The TCFD was founded by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system, in December 2015. The TCFD encourages organizations to conduct scenario analysis, which involves assessing the potential financial impact of different climate-related scenarios, including both transition risks (related to policy and market changes) and physical risks (related to climate impacts like extreme weather events). The International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) issued the first two sustainability standards, the IFRS S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-related Financial Information and the IFRS S2 Climate-related Disclosures. They will theoretically become effective on or after January 1, 2024. If jurisdictions challenge or delay bringing them into law, the effective date may well be later. IFRS S1 provides a set of disclosure requirements designed to enable companies to communicate to investors about the sustainability-related risks and opportunities they face over the short, medium and long term. IFRS S2 sets out specific climate-related disclosures and is designed to be used with IFRS S1. Both fully incorporate the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Conclusion China, the US, and India have been, for a while now, the largest polluter nations. However, statistics do not look at the indirect pollution cost of countries that produce abroad for internal consumption. If we take that cost into consideration, it becomes evident that sustainability regulations at both national and international level are crucial for addressing environmental and social challenges. Regulations alone are obviously not enough. Strict enforcement and monitoring are what is going to transform national and supra-national entities, regional authorities, businesses, communities, and individuals into responsible actors.

September 202311 min read This post is also available in: Download PDF By Ilinca Anghelescu, Global Director Marketing Communications, EW Nutrition This may be the year that climate change has arrived in humanity’s backyard, driving home the repercussions of human action and the finite nature of our planet’s resources. More than ever, it is also becoming clear that we cannot fight climate change in our own backyard but that long-term cross-border action is imperative. With the visible threat of extreme events nearer than ever, companies and countries feel pressured to show their commitment to sustainable practices. The shape this commitment takes is, however, very different. The slew of regulations and policies directly or indirectly aimed at promoting sustainability may take the shape of water or energy management, environmental protection, specific business practice regulations, and may or may not include reporting obligations and monitoring bodies. Some international initiatives are attempting to impose such obligations, with varying degrees of success. Reading between the lines, the number of regulations is not the problem; it is the competencies in standardizing and enforcing these regulations that prove more difficult. Sustainability regulations in the European Union The European Union is both the fastest warming region (with the exception of the Arctic) and probably the most advanced in terms of regulatory pressure. It has been steadily developing not just specific regulations aimed at green growth, but also specific reporting tools to avoid greenwashing and standardize the monitoring and measuring of this commitment. The largest sustainability initiative, the EU’s Green Deal, unveiled in 2019, is a comprehensive policy framework aimed at making Europe the world’s first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Among its objectives are reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy efficiency, and promoting circular economy practices. Key regulations include: European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS): The EU ETS is a “cap and trade” scheme that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. It is the first and largest carbon market, covering around 45% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and is operational across the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. The system works by setting a cap on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted by all participating installations. Within this cap, operators buy or receive emissions allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. The fourth phase started in January 2021 and is to continue until December 2030, however the reduction target for 2030 needs to be reassessed. Single-Use Plastics Directive: This regulation aims to reduce single-use plastics and their impact on the environment by banning certain products and promoting recycling. Circular Economy Action Plan: Designed to reduce waste and promote recycling, this plan outlines initiatives to make products more durable and easier to repair. The plan includes measures on product design, waste management, and resource efficiency. Taxonomy Regulation: This regulation establishes an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. The taxonomy defines which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable, based on their contribution to environmental objectives such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, and water protection. More recent but directly concerned with regulating and reporting sustainability in business practices are the following: Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR): The SFDR requires financial market participants and advisers to disclose information about how they integrate sustainability risks into their investment decisions, consider and disclose the adverse impacts of their investments on sustainability factors. Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD): This requires companies to report on a wide range of sustainability issues, including environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. The reporting requirements will be phased in, starting from January 1, 2024, for certain large EU and EU-listed companies, and will apply to all in-scope companies by January 1, 2028. In addition to these regulations, the EU also provides financial support for sustainable projects through its Horizon Europe research and innovation program. Horizon Europe has a budget of €95.5 billion for the period 2021-2027, and a significant portion of this funding will be used to support research and innovation in areas such as climate change mitigation, renewable energy, and sustainable agriculture. Sustainability regulations in the United States The United States traditionally has a more decentralized approach to regulations, with federal, state, and local governments all playing important roles. Key federal regulations and initiatives in the field of sustainability include: Clean Air Act: Enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), this law aims to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. This law regulates air pollution from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, and vehicles. The Clean Air Act has helped to reduce air pollution in the US by over 70% since it was passed in 1970. Clean Water Act: Also administered by the EPA, this act sets standards for water quality, aiming to protect aquatic ecosystems. This law regulates water pollution from a variety of sources, including factories, farms, and sewage treatment plants. The Clean Water Act has helped to improve water quality in the US by over 70% since it was passed in 1972. Renewable Energy Tax Credits: Also called Residential Clean Energy Credits, these incentives encourage the development and use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. More recent, targeted sustainability actions and regulations in the US include: Executive Order 14057: Issued by President Biden in 2021, the Executive Order on Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability requires federal agencies to take steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy. ESG Disclosure Simplification Act: This bill, passed by the House of Representatives in 2021, would require public companies to disclose more information about their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Methane Emissions Reduction Plan: The White House Action Plan, together with the Supplemental Methane Proposal put forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2022, would require primarily oil and gas companies to reduce methane emissions from their operations. Sustainable Electricity Plan: This plan, released by the Department of Energy in 2022, outlines the Biden administration’s goals for increasing the use of renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector. SEC Climate-Related Disclosures/ESG Investing: Prompted by the Climate Risk Disclosure Act of 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a rule proposal that would require US publicly traded companies to disclose annually how their businesses are assessing, measuring, and managing climate-related risks. This would include climate-related risks and their material impacts on the registrant’s business, strategy, and outlook; governance of climate-related risks; greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions; certain climate-related financial statement metrics and related disclosures; information about climate-related targets and goals, and transition plan, if any. Some companies would have to already start reporting in 2023 for 2023. However, it is likely the proposal will undergo several rounds of revisions. In addition to these federal laws, there are also a number of state and local sustainability regulations. U.S. regulations generally lack cohesion, with the federal government’s role fluctuating depending on the administration in power. Still, there is growing momentum towards sustainability, driven by grassroots movements and corporate initiatives. Sustainability regulations in China China, the world’s largest polluter, faces significant sustainability challenges as it grapples with rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic growth. It has made substantial progress, particularly in renewable energy adoption, but still faces challenges of implementation. Carbon Neutrality Commitment: In September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced China’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2060. This ambitious goal involves reducing carbon emissions to net-zero by mid-century. Renewable Energy Development: China is a global leader in renewable energy deployment. It has set targets for increasing the share of renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydropower in its energy mix. Initiatives include the National Renewable Energy Development Plan and the 13th Five-Year Plan for Energy Development. Emissions Trading System (ETS): China has launched a national carbon emissions trading system, which is the world’s largest such program.
